			<h2 id="about">About</h2>
			
			<p>This website is written almost entirely in HTML and CSS. The point of this website is to help
			   teach myself web design, and make a personal website that looks good enough to show off to 
			   employers and friends. The design of the site has evolved over several months as I learned of new ways
			   to do things and thought of more elements that would look cool. I also sometimes use the site to host
			   pieces of projects for classes. To see the history of changes I've made to the site, check out my
			   <a href="https://github.com/jojonium/josephpetitti.com">GitHub</a> page.</p>
			   
			<p>The HTML and CSS is written entirely from scratch by myself, without any website-building tool or
			   service. The only program I use is the excellent <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org">Notepad++
			   </a>. The site was originally hosted using <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>, 
			   but in July 2018 I switched to self hosting it on a server I built and set up (see <a href="#self-hosting">below</a>).</p>

			<p>Unfortunately, one of the issues I've run into is that I don't know what to actually write!
			   It turns out that creating good-looking pages is a lot easier than coming up with interesting
			   content to put on them.</p>
			
			<p>Also, I have discovered that CSS is annoying. Now I'm pretty competent with it, but it took
			   many frustrating hours to learn everything. For example, these parallax headers look really
			   cool, but it took a <i>very</i> long time to figure out how to position everything properly.</p>
			
			<div class="parallax p3">
				<div class="parallax-header" style="background-color: #e37682;">PARALLAX IS COOL</div>
			</div>
			
			<hr>
			
			<div id="vis" style="padding: 4em 3em .5em 0; float: left;"></div>
			
			<h2 id="vega-lite">Vega-Lite</h2>
			
			<p>However, it's not all HTML and CSS. I used some JavaScript to make the cool visualizations
			   across the site. The graphs on the <a href="film-stats">Film Stats</a> page were made using
			   <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/">Vega-Lite</a>, a JSON schema for creating beautiful
			   graphs quickly and easily.</p>
			
			<p>I learned Vega-Lite for a class (CS 3041, Human Computer Interactions), and realized I could 
               apply what I learned to my own film data to make gather some interesting insights.</p>
			   
			<p>To the left is another Vega-Lite graph, this one showing the films I've watched each month by 
               release date. I'm not sure why there are two different categories for "null" and "undefined,"
               but I blame <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org">TMDb</a>.</p>

            <canvas width="500" height="500" id="seen-canvas" style="float: right;"></canvas>

			<h2 id="seen.js">seen.js</h2>
			 
			<p>The visualization on the <a href="index">front page</a> was created using <a href=
			   "http://seenjs.io">seen.js</a>, a JavaScript framework for rendering 3D scenes into an SVG 
			   or HTML5 canvas. The scenes are written in <a href="http://coffeescript.org">CoffeeScript</a>,
			   a cleaner and simpler language that compiles into JavaScript.</p>
			   
            <p>It was quite simple to just link the minified CoffeeScript and seen.js scripts and copy the 
               examples from the seen.js website. However, almost all of their examples (like the sphere to the
               right), were set to generate random colors for each surface. I wanted the colors of the main page
			   visualization to match the color scheme of the site.</p>
               
            <p>I wanted the color of the surfaces to range smoothly between the two colors of the background,
               #e37682 and #5f4d93. I couldn't find a built-in function to do this, so I wrote one myself.
               First, seen.js applies colors to surfaces not with hex values, and not even with RGB, but with
               HSL values. It uses three numbers between 0 and 1, representing the hue, saturation, and 
               lightness of the color. Converted into hues, the two theme colors are 0.70833 and 0.980555. I
               wrote this snippet of CoffeeScript code to loop over each surface in the shape and apply a
               color:</p>
            
            <div class="code">hue = <span style="color: orange">0.70833</span>
    <span style="color: blue">for</span> surface <span style="color: blue">in</span> shape.surfaces
        hue += (<span style="color: orange">.272225</span>) * (<span style="color: orange">1</span> / shape.surfaces.length)
        surface.fill seen.Colors.hsl(hue, <span style="color: orange">0.5</span>, <span style="color: orange">0.4<span>)</div>

            <p>It applies the 0.70833 color to the
               first surface, then increments the hue by the difference between the two colors (.272225)
               multiplied by the inverse of the number of surfaces. This makes a smooth transition over the
               surface of the entire shape.</p>

			<p>My personal logo, shown on the left, is a design I came up with as a kid. The color scheme is completely
			   arbitrary (being color blind and knowing nothing about graphic design makes it better to just pick
			   colors out of a hat than try to figure out what matches what).</p>
			
			<p>I made the original digital version of the logo years ago in Microsoft PowerPoint and exported it as
			   a .png. However, at some point I lost the original file. Because the .png was small and didn't scale
			   very well I decided to remake the logo as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a>.</p>
			   
			<p>Still knowing nothing about graphic design, I painstakingly wrote the code for the SVG by hand, and it
			   is reproduced in all its glory below:</p>

			<h2 id="self-hosting">Self Hosting</h2>
			
			<p>In July of 2018 I decided to stop relying on Github Pages and host the website on my own server.
			   This decision came for several reasons. GitHub Pages was a nice service, but it doesn't have good
			   support for HTTPS. Also, if I ever want my website to be anything but static HTML pages and
			   client-side scripts GitHub pages won't work for my needs any more. Plus, I had an old computer
			   lying around and a strong desire to learn about servers and networking.</p>
			   
			<p>First, I installed <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/server">Ubuntu Server</a> 18.04 LTS on the server,
			   and set up an SSH connection from my main desktop. From there, I installed <a href="https://nginx.org">nginx</a>
			   and used it to configure a reverse proxy so I could have multiple servers running on the same machine. I
			   acquired an SSL certificate from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let's Encrypt</a>, and set an nginx
			   rule to rewrite all HTTP requests to HTTPS. With this and other security measures in place, I cloned
			   the website from GitHub and changed the A records in my domain name registrar to point to the server, and
			   now my little server is broadcasting to the whole world. I even added a cron job to the server to
			   automatically pull from GitHub every ten minutes to keep the site up to date</p>

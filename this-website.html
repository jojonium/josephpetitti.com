      <h2 id="about">About</h2>

      <p>
        This website is written almost entirely in plain HTML and CSS. The point
        of this website is to help teach myself web design, and make a personal
        website that looks good enough to show off to employers and friends. The
        design of the site has evolved over many months as I learned of new ways
        to do things and thought of more elements that would look cool. I also
        sometimes use the site to host pieces of projects for classes. To see
        the history of changes I've made to the site, check out the
        <a href="https://github.com/jojonium/josephpetitti.com">git repository</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The HTML and CSS is written entirely from scratch by myself, without any
        website-building tool or service. The only program I use is a simple
        text editor (<a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org">Notepad++</a> on
        Windows and <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> on GNU/Linux), and
        Chomiums's developer tools. The site was originally hosted using 
        <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>, but in July 2018 I
        switched to self hosting it on a server I built and set up (see
        <a href="#self-hosting">below</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, one of the issues I've run into is that I don't know what
        to actually write! It turns out that creating good-looking pages is a
        lot easier than coming up with interesting content to put on them.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also struggled a lot with CSS at first. It's hard to wrap your head
        around how all the rules interact with each other for someone used to
        functional and imperative programming languages. For example, it took me
        a lot of frustrating trial and error to figure out how to get these
        <a href="#heading-background">heading styles</a> working, but once I
        figured it out it was all worth it.
      </p>

      <div class="fade-box">

      <p>
        Although I want my websites to be completely usable without JavaScript,
        I still use some here and there, for eye candy or simple games and
        projects. The visualizations on the <a href="projects">projects</a> and 
        <a href="other">other</a> pages were created using
        <a href="http://seenjs.io">seen.js</a>, a JavaScript framework for
        rendering 3D scenes into an SVG or HTML5 canvas.
      </p>

      <p>
        These visualizations are not necessary for navigating the site, so I
        consider them an acceptable use of JavaScript. They add a bit of
        flavor and color to the pages while using less bandwidth and loading
        faster than images.

      <p>
        My personal logo, shown on the left, is a design I came up with as a
        kid. I'm red-green colorblind, so I find it easier to just pick colors
        randomly than to try spend time trying to figure out what looks good
        together. As a result, the color scheme is completely arbitrary.
      </p>

      <p>
        To make it load fast and scale well on different-sized screens, I made
        the logo an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a>.
        Knowing nothing about graphic design, I painstakingly wrote the code for
        the SVG by hand, and it is reproduced in all its glory below:

      <h2 id="self-hosting">Self Hosting</h2>

      <p>
        In July of 2018 I decided to stop relying on Github Pages and host the
        website on my own server. This decision came for several reasons.
        GitHub Pages was a nice service, but it doesn't have good support for
        HTTPS. Also, if I ever want my website to be anything but static HTML
        pages and client-side scripts GitHub Pages won't work for my needs any
        more. Plus, I had an old computer lying around and a strong desire to
        learn about servers and networking.
      </p>

      <figure class="float right">

        </a>
        <figcaption>My personal data center/fire hazard</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        First, I installed <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/server">Ubuntu
        Server</a> 18.04 GNU/Linux on the server, and set up an SSH connection
        from my main desktop. From there, I installed
        <a href="https://nginx.org">nginx</a> and used it to configure a reverse
        proxy so I could have multiple servers with different domains running on
        the same machine. I acquired an SSL certificate from
        <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let's Encrypt</a>, and set an nginx
        rule to rewrite all HTTP requests to HTTPS. With this and other security
        measures in place, I cloned the website from GitHub and changed my DNS
        records, and now I was hosting my very own piece of the world wide web.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before this point I had very little GNU/Linux experience, and had never
        interacted with a computer purely through the command line interface.
        The process of learning everything was slow and frustrating at first. As
        is often the case with these things, nearly everything that could go
        wrong did go wrong. But I got it working in the end, and learned a lot
        about GNU/Linux and system administration along the way.
      </p>

      <p>
        This setup lasted for almost a year. But by May 2019 the original server
        was starting to show its age and it was time to upgrade to something
        more powerful. Read more about it <a href="#getting-an-upgrade">below</a>.

      <h2 id="new-design">New Design</h2>

      <p>
        In April 2019, about a year after I first started working on the
        website, I decided to revamp it with a fresh design. The original design
        wasn't responsive on mobile, and my <span class="code">style.css</span>
        was full of accumulated cruft from when I was first learning web design.
        I wanted a fresh start to show off my newfound mastery of flexboxes,
        transition animations, and responsive design.
      </p>

      <p>
        The original site is preserved in a
        <a href="https://github.com/jojonium/josephpetitti.com/tree/old-style">
        separate branch</a> for posterity, and is still live on the web
        <a href="old">here</a>.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/old-design.png">
          <img src="images/th_old-design.png" alt="Old index page">
        </a>
        <figcaption>
          The original design of the index page
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        This design was good enough (and actually helped me get a job), but the
        accumulation of janky CSS hacks over a year made it difficult to add to
        it consistently. The navigation bar also relied on hover states, which
        made it unusable on mobile. Instead of hacking together a fix for the
        existing 500-line stylesheet I decided to start over.
      </p>

      <h3 id="design-principles">Design Principles</h3>

      <p>
        I designed the new website style with these principles in mind:
      </p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Simplicity</b>: the site should be simple and easy to read, with a
            minimal number of unique elements and different colors
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Mobile compatibility</b>: everything should look good and be usable
          on mobile, but the desktop experience should not be sacrificed for
          this
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Extensibility</b>: It should be easy for me to add new elements and
          different kinds of pages in the future
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3 id="navigation-bar">Navigation Bar</h3>

      <p>
        In desktop mode, the navigation bar remains mostly the same since the
        previous version, but gains some fancy new transition animations.
        However, in mobile mode it changes into an expanding side-menu with a
        <span class="code">@media</span> CSS selector. Originally this behavior
        was implemented with JavaScript, but I wanted my site to be navigable
        with scripts disabled, so I replaced this mechanism with pure CSS.
      </p>

      <figure class="float right">
        <img src="images/new-mobile-view.png" alt="New mobile version"
        style="box-shadow: 0 0 2px 1px #667788">
        <figcaption>
          The new mobile version of the site
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        It works through a well-known CSS hack, involving an invisible checkbox
        and abuse of the "<code>~</code>" sibling selector. An invisible
        checkbox element lurks out of sight on every page, while its
        <code>label</code> elements wrap the "Menu" and "Close" buttons. When
        you click the label of a checkbox, it toggles the actual element's
        checked status. The label doesn't have to be anywhere near the actual
        checkbox, and the checkbox itself can be invisible, allowing you to
        toggle styling of arbitrary elements using pure CSS with a selector like
        this:
      </p>

      <code class="block" style="width: auto">nav {
  height: 100%;
  position: fixed;
  left: 0;
  top: 0;
  width: 0;
  transition: width .8s;
  z-index: 2;
  background-color: #005377;
  overflow: auto;
  white-space: nowrap;
}

input[type=checkbox]:checked ~ nav {
  width: 100%;
}</code>

      <p>
        The invisible checkbox is right next to the <code>nav</code>, so we can
        use the general sibling combinator (<code>~</code>) to style it.
      </p>


      <p>
        The <span class="code">@media</span> selector makes the site dynamically
        adjust as the viewport width is changed. The animation the shows the
        nav-bar opening is just a CSS transition:
      </p>

      <h3 id="heading-background">Heading Background</h3>

      <p>
        The light textured background behind page titles is also just a simple
        CSS trick. Each page's <span class="code">main</span> element has a
        <span class="code">::before</span> pseudo-element positioned behind the
        top of the page. This pseudo-element has a composite background image,
        consisting of a small, mostly-transparent image repeated across the
        page, and a gradient to create the "fading out" effect.
      </p>

      <div class="code clear">main::before {
  position: absolute;
  content: "";
  left: 10%;
  top: 0;
  width: 80%;
  height: 800px;
  z-index: -1;
  background-repeat: repeat;

        is rendered client-side, which keeps load times fast.

        For the background of the <a href="index">index</a> page I used
        <a href="https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/">particles.js</a>, a
        lightweight, free JavaScript library for creating particle effects. It's
        configured with a simple JSON file and sits on top of a
        <code>::before</code> pseudo-element with a slightly lighter background
        color that fades to the standard background color with a linear
        gradient. It creates a neat effect without being obtrusive, and if you
        have JavaScript disabled it doesn't break any important functionality.

        By May of 2018 the old HP EliteDesk I had been using as a server was
        starting to get sluggish. The number of services I was running had
        steadily increased over the ten months it was active, and the server
        could no longer keep up. It was also horribly insecure, and the
        accumulation of cruft made it hard to add anything new.
      </p>

      <figure class="float left">
        <a href="images/poweredge-r710.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_poweredge-r710.jpg" alt="A Dell PowerEdge R710">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        For better security and performance, I decided to switch to a virtual
        environment running on real enterprise-level server hardware. Building a
        custom network of virtual machines would allow me to split up the
        various services I was running and learn more about system
        administration and networking.
      </p>

      <p>
        I could have just used <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> for
        this task, but I wanted to set things up manually so I could learn the
        process. I also didn't want to have to rely on an external provider,
        whose prices could increase in the future. I purchased a used Dell
        PowerEdge R710 for the task, along with a new RAID card and some new
        hard drives.
      </p>

      <p>
        This time around I had a lot more GNU/Linux experience, and felt more
        confident in my abilities. I chose 
        <a href="https://www.centos.org/">CentOS</a> as the OS to run on bare
        metal, and set up <a href="https://libvirt.org/">libvirt</a> with
        <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a> for virtualization. For
        high-level VM management I used 
        <a href="https://theforeman.org/">Foreman</a>, which allows me to easily
        provision and manage hosts on my network. With these tools, I can create
        a new virtual machine, have it PXE boot into an installer image, install
        a GNU/Linux operating system, update and install necessary packages,
        configure a network interface for my virtual and physical networks,
        automatically create entries for my internal DNS server, set up users
        and remote execution SSH keys, and register them with 
        <a href="https://puppet.com/">Puppet</a>, all completely unattended.
        Admittedly, it took a long time to get all of these services to work
        together nicely, but it was worth it in the end.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the virtual servers I chose to run Fedora 30. One of them runs nginx
        as a reverse proxy and serves the static pages of this websites, while
        others provide other services, each neatly compartmentalized and
        separated. 
        <a href="https://selinuxproject.org/page/Main_Page">SELinux</a> and 
        <a href="https://firewalld.org/">firewalld</a> allow only what each
        server needs to function.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once again, almost everything that could go wrong did go wrong in this
        process. Because I couldn't find an up-to-date guide to installing
        Foreman and libvirt I created my own, 
        <a href="blog/adventures-in-system-administration-part-1">here</a> and
        <a href="blog/adventures-in-system-administration-part-2">here</a>. It
        took over a month between when I bought the new server and when it was
        fully operational, but I learned a lot in that time. If I had to start
        over from scratch I could probably recreate the entire network in a day
        at this point.

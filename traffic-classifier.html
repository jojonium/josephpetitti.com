      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

      <p>
        For this project for CS 4516: Advanced Computer Networks, I worked with
        a partner to implement an Internet Protocol (IP) gateway that intercepts
        traffic from an Android x86 6.0 virtual machine, separates packets into
        flows, and uses a random forest classifier to predict which application
        they came from, despite the packet payloads being encrypted.
      </p>

      <p>
        This project was inspired by a <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/publications/publication11116-abstract.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
        paper</a> we read for class. In the paper, researchers describe a
        framework, called AppScanner, for classifying encrypted smartphone
        network traffic, and correlating flows to specific applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        This project shows that traffic classification is still possible despite
        the use of encryption. Even without knowing the specific contents of
        packets, you can still perform fingerprinting based on various features
        of the encrypted flows.
      </p>

      <p>
        We were able to reimplement a small part of what the researchers made
        for AppScanner, and achieved acceptable accuracy for a small set of test
        applications.
      </p>

      <h2 id="phase-1">Phase 1</h2>

      <p>
        For this phase, we configured a TinyCore VM to act as a gateway. We set
        up an SSH connection to the virtual machine from the host machine and
        configured the Android x86 6.0 and TinyCore VMs to work on the same
        virtual network.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <img src="images/virtualbox-config.png" alt="VirtualBox configuration"/>
        <figcaption>VirtualBox network configuration</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3 id="ip-gateway">IP Gateway</h3>

      <p>
        Next, we configured the eth1 interface of TinyCore to have the static IP
        address 192.168.12.1, netmask 255.255.255.0. This is the interface that
        connects to the Internet. TinyCore's other (virtual) interface, eth0,
        will be hooked up to the Android VM. We also used iptables to route
        packets from eth0 to the Internet and dback. Now TinyCore can act like a
        gateway middlebox.
      </p>

      <h3 id="dhcp-server">DHCP Server</h3>

      <p>
        We also wanted TinyCore to act as a DHCP server for its subnet. We used
        the program udhcpd with this configuration file to do that:
      </p>

      <div class="code">start 192.168.12.100
end 192.168.12.200
interface eth1
option subnet 255.255.255.0
option router 192.168.12.1
option lease 43200
option dns 10.0.2.3       # the address of VirtualBox&#39;s DNS server
option domain network2</div>

      <h3 id="startup-script">Startup Script</h3>

      <p>
        Finally, we needed to persist these changes so they apply every time the
        TinyCore VM reboots. We wrote this script, 
        <span class="code">/opt/eth1.sh</span>, to run at startup and apply all
        the configurations. This script kills the udhcpc process if it's already
        running, configures eth1 interface, and then starts the udhcpc server
        process.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2 id="phase-2">Phase 2</h2>

      <p>
        For this phase, we wrote a Python script called
        <span class="code">logFlows</span> that captures packets from the
        Android VM and separates them into bursts and flows. A flow is defined
        as a sequence of packets with the same source IP, source port,
        destination IP, and destination port. A burst is a group of flows
        separated by gaps of greater than one second of silence. After each
        burst, the program prints a report on which each flow in that burst, in
        the following format:
      </p>

      <div class="code">&lt;timestamp&gt; &lt;src addr&gt; &lt;dst addr&gt; &lt;src port&gt; &lt;dst port&gt; &lt;proto&gt; \
&lt;#packets sent&gt; &lt;#packets rcvd&gt; &lt;#bytes send&gt; &lt;#bytes rcvd&gt;</div> 

      <p>
        As our program is capturing packets, we record each "half" flow, which
        is the traffic going in a single direcction. At the end of a burst, we
        match each half flow to its corresponding half flow in order to create a
        "full" flow which encapsulates all of the traffic going between two
        hosts.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have a daemon process that runs in the background in order to detect
        the end of a burst during live packet capture. This process checks every
        fifth of a second to see if the last packet received is over one second
        old. If this is the case, the recorded half flows are matched into full
        flows and the statistics for each flow are printed to the standard
        output.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="code">logFlows</span> uses Python 2 and requires the Python
        package scapy, which can be easily installed with pip. Note that it must
        be run as root on TinyCore.
      </p>
      
      <hr>

      <h2 id="phase-3">Phase 3</h2>
        
      <p>
        In phase 3, we implemented an offline machine learning classifier. We
        wrote a script, <span class="code">pcapper.py</span>, that runs on the
        TinyCore gateway VM, captures packets from eth1, and writes them to PCAP
        files. Another script, <span class="code">trainer.py</span>, builds a
        classification model based on the feature vectors described
        <a href="#classification-vectors">below</a>. The final script, 
        <span class="code">ClassifyFlows</span>, takes in a PCAP packet trace and
        the model created by <span class="code">trainer.py</span>, and attempts
        to identify which application each flow in the PCAP file came from.
      </p>

      <h3 id="classification-vectors">Classification Vectors</h3>

      <p>
        While we were in the process of trying to make the machine learning
        component as accurate as possible, we continually added features in the
        hopes of improving the accuracy of the model. Our feature vector
        originally contained only five elements, and expanded to fourteen
        elements as we iterated on our strategy for machine learning.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following measurements were elements of the feature vector:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Byte ratio (bytes sent / bytes received, or reciprocal)</li>
        <li>Packet ratio (packets sent / packets received, or reciprocal)</li>
        <li>Mean packet length</li>
        <li>Standard deviation of packet lengths (zero if n &#8804; 2)</li>
        <li>Packet length kurtosis</li>
        <li>Packet length skew</li>
        <li>Mean time gap between each packet (zero if n &#8804; 1)</li>
        <li>Time gap kurtosis</li>
        <li>Time gap skew</li>
        <li>Min packet length</li>
        <li>Max packet length</li>
        <li>Min time gap</li>
        <li>Max time gap</li>
        <li>Protocol (1 for TCP, 0 for UDP)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        As you can see from the list above, the bulk of the features are
        statistical measures for two main lists. The first list is simply the
        lengths of all the packets in the flow. The second list is the gaps of
        time between each packet arrival. Because this list records the
        intervals, if there were only two packets in a flow this list would be
        only one item long.
      </p>

      <h3 id="test-data">Test Data</h3>

      We collected four rounds of packets traces for each of the applications
      being tested. Each round of training data collection took around thirty
      minutes to an hour. Certain applications generated many megabytes of data.
      This was especially true for applications that regularly streamed video,
      such as YouTube. Other applications generated far less traffic, such as
      Fruit Ninja, which played ads at relatively infrequent intervals. In
      total, we collected 314 MiB of data in order to train our classifier.

      <h3 id="classification-model">Classification Model</h3>

      <p>
        Our first attempt at a classification model used support vector
        classification. The implementation of this classifier in sklearn
        currently has issues with data containing very large and very small
        numbers; the classifier took many minutes to train instead of seconds.
        Because of this, it was difficult to work with as we rapidly collected
        more data to train our model. We tried to do our own normalization, but
        this did not help appreciably.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because of these difficulties, we moved to a random forest classifer. We
        were able to train this model much more quickly than our previous
        method, and this model appeared to provide better accuracy.
      </p>

          <tr>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
        Excluding unknown flows we were able to get above 50% accuracy.
        Additionally, each application's accuracy was better than simply
        guessing (&gt; 20%).
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2 id="phase-4">Phase 4</h2>
      
      <p>
        For this phase we combined all the previous phases to make a complete
        project. Since we trained the model on a 64-bit machine for Phase 3, we
        had to retrain the model to work on 32-bit TinyCore. We then set it up
        to run continuously on the VM. It captures live packets from the Android
        VM and classifies them in real time, writing the results of each
        classification to standard output.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Python script that performs this live classification is called
        analyzeFlows. This is essentially a modified version of classifyFlows
        from Phase 3 that sniffs packets and performs classification in real
        time instead of from a PCAP file. At the end of a burst, each flow is
        printed in the format specified <a href="#phase-2">here</a>, but also
        prints out the predicted application name for each flow. If the
        classifier is not particularly confident about any one classification,
        "unknown" is printed in place of the application name.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2 id="lessons-learned-and-limitations">
        Lessons Learned and Limitations
      </h2>

      <p>
        The first machine learning-related hurdle was our difficulty getting the
        model trained in a reasonable amount of time. We tried to use a support
        vector classifier in both linear and polynomial modes. Neither had good
        performance, and they both took a very long time to train, even with
        small amounts of data and very short feature vectors. We discovered that
        this was an inherent problem with sklearn’s implementation of this
        classifier, which has issues with data that is not normalized. The
        random forest classifier did not have these issues, so we elected to
        retrain our model with this classifier partway through Phase 3 of the
        project.
      </p>

      <p>
        The other issue that prevented us from attaining a higher accuracy was
        that the process of collecting training data was quite slow. We could
        have elected to automate this process, but we were hesitant to do so
        because we were concerned this would bias the classifier with data
        produced by non-human interaction with the software.
      </p>

      <p>
       We also had some trouble with configuring TinyCore in Phase 1 since it is
       very different from most GNU/Linux installations. We fixed these issues
       by essentially starting over from scratch.
      </p> 

      <p>
        Our choice of classification model and design of feature vectors were
        not entirely educated because neither of us have taken a machine
        learning class. We also had no experience with scikit-learn. We tried to
        educate ourselves on how these models worked, but despite our efforts
        they essentially remained a "black box" due to the time constraints.
      </p>

      <p>
        We were puzzled as to why our classifier was strongly biased towards the
        Weather Channel app. We hypothesize that the Weather Channel’s app
        performs a variety of network applications including video,
        advertisements, and asynchronous data requests, which makes it easy to

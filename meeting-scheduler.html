      <p>
        This project was done for CS 3733: Software Engineering. It was
        completed by a <a href="#team">team</a> of four students in about three
        weeks. The goal was to create a fully functional web application,
        including a public API, HTML/CSS/JavaScript front-end, and MySQL
        database. We used Amazon Web Services for the back-end and Angular for
        the front-end. The finished project's code can be seen at 
        <a href="https://github.com/jojonium/CS-3733" target="_blank">GitHub</a>,
        or it can be seen in action on 
        <a href="https://algol.petitti.org" target="_blank">our website</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> Unfortunately due to the rising costs of AWS we had to shut
        down the backend portions of the Algol Meeting Scheduler in early 2019.
        You can still see the frontend, but portions of the site won't work.
      </p>

      <p>
        The actual application is designed to allow users to set up a meeting
        schedule and send it to others, so that they can request meetings are
        particular times with the organizer.
      </p>

      <h3>Organizers</h3>

      <p>
        Organizers can specify a starting and ending date for their schedule, as
        well as a daily starting time and ending time. They can also select a
        preferred meeting length, from ten minutes to an hour. Organizers can
        open or close specific time slots, as well as all time slots at a
        particular time or on a particular day. If a time slot is closed,
        participants can not schedule a meeting for that time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once an organizer has created a schedule, she is given a schedule ID and
        a secret code. The schedule ID can be given to participants, or shared
        as a URL such as 
        <a>https://algol.petitti.org/schedule/<i>8bDj38</i></a>. The secret code
        is for the organizer to use if she wants to edit the schedule in the
        future. For example, she could extend the start or end dates or close
        particular time slots. The organizer can also use the secret code to see
        the names of all participants and when their meetings are scheduled for.
      </p>

        </a>
        <figcaption>The schedule view that participants can see</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Participants</h3>

      <p>
        A participant can access a schedule by using its schedule ID. From here,
        he can request a meeting on a particular time and date, as long as the
        time slot is open and no other participant has requested a meeting at
        that same time. Participants are given a secret code when they request a
        meeting.
      </p>

      <h2 id="development">Development</h2>

      <p>
        Our team had one week to plan out the project, including designing the
        API using Swagger, drawing up UML diagrams, and writing out use cases.
        Then, from November 26 to December 14, 2018 we worked at a feverish pace
        to complete the entire project.
      </p>

      <h3>Back-End</h3>

      <p>
        The back-end of the project was done in AWS. API requests are processed
        by an AWS API gateway, then passed along to a relevant lambda function.
        These lambda functions were written in Java using the
        Entity-Boundary-Controller design scheme. The lambda functions parse the
        incoming JSON data into Java objects, then completes the requested
        action. They connect to the database, a MySQL instance running in AWS
        RDS, through JDBC.
      </p>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Front-End</h3>

      <p>
        The front-end was done in Google's Angular framework, using Google's
        material design elements and guidelines. Angular applications are
        written in TypeScript, a superscript of JavaScript that compiles to
        plain JavaScript. The front-end ended up being a miniature
        Entity-Boundary-Controller project, with TypeScript object entities,
        HTML/CSS boundaries, and TypeScript controllers that make the API calls.
      </p>

      <h2 id="team">Team</h2>

      <p>
        The class was divided into groups of four students, and each group was
        given a team name based on the names of stars. I was already friends
        with the three other group members I worked with before the class, so it
        was easy for me to find a group. Since our team was the first to sign
        up, we got the "A" star name, Algol.
      </p>

          <h2>Joseph Petitti</h2>

          <p>
          Joseph Petitti was the fearless leader of Team Algol. He wrote the
          entire front-end in TypeScript for Google's Angular framework, set up
          much of the AWS back-end, designed and deployed the API, and spent far
          too many late nights debugging and testing.

          Justin Cheng set up the relational database for the project in AWS,

          lambda functions. He was our database expert and wrote all the SQL
          statements and queries necessary for this web app to work.

          being the EBC Controller lead for this project, working primarily with
          the Lambdas to ensure that the boundary and entity control flow ran
          smoothly.

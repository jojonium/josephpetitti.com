      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

      <p>
        To complete my <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/academics/undergraduate/major-qualifying-project">Major
        Qualifying Project</a>, WPI's undergraduate capstone project, I spent
        three months in Kyoto, Japan working with two other WPI students to
        develop a platform for
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality">augmented
        reality</a> (AR) walking tour experiences.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinkaku-ji">Kinkaku-ji</a>, the
        Temple of the Golden Pavilion, is one of Kyoto's most visited tourist
        attractions. However, most people who visit the site do not have the
        opportunity to experience the rich art and culture that are part of its
        history. We worked with our sponsor,
        <a href="https://kyoto-vr.com/en/">Kyoto VR</a>, to create an app that
        would allow visitors of Kinkaku-ji to better experience these aspects of
        the site.  We used Unity to create an audio tour app that provides
        historical insight on the location, displays galleries of art throughout
        the visit, and offers accessibility features through AR. We also
        developed a web application to aid in the design and creation of these
        audio tours.
      </p>

      <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

      <p>
        In July 2019 I went to Kyoto, Japan for three months with six other WPI
        students. We stayed at <a href="http://en.ritsumei.ac.jp/">Ritsumeikan
        University</a>'s Biwako-Kusatsu Campus (technically in Shiga prefecture,
        but close enough to Kyoto), and had access to their labs and faculty. My
        team consisted of three Seniors: myself, a computer science major;
        <a href="http://www.bandaloo.fun">Cole Granof</a>, computer science
        major; and <a href="https://github.com/wscampbell/">Will Campbell</a>,
        computer science and interactive media and game development double
        major.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Japan we fulfilled the requirements for the Major Qualifying Project,
        a WPI graduation requirement in which students solve a real-world
        problem through practical project-based work. Our project was sponsored
        by <a href="https://kyoto-vr.com/en/">Kyoto VR</a>, a startup founded in
        2016 to "document and preserve the culture and heritage of the city and
        communicate the richness of Japan's Old Capital to the world."

      <h2 id="aruko">ARuko&mdash;An AR Walking Tour App</h2>

      <p>
        My team worked directly under Kyoto VR founder and CEO Atticus Sims to
        develop and test a mobile app to deliver an audio tour, incorporating
        various augmented reality features to enhance the experience. The app,
        which we named ARuko (from 歩こ <i>aruko</i>, roughly "let's walk," and
        AR) was created in <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> using the 
        <a href="https://developer.vuforia.com">Vuforia Augmented Reality
        SDK</a>. This allowed us to quickly develop a professional-level
        application, and easily deploy to both iOS and Android.
      </p>

      <p>
        We focused on designing a tour of Kinkaku-ji for the app, but made it
        extensible so Kyoto VR could create tours of other locations using the
        same app in the future.
      </p>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3 id="gps-functionality">GPS Functionality</h3>

      <p>
        The core experience of ARuko is the walking tour. By walking the given
        route, the user enters and exits specific geographic regions that invoke
        changes in the app, such as playing a portion of the audio tour related
        to a specific area and displaying relevant images. We provided a robust
        system for defining polygons of arbitrary size and shape using GPS
        coordinates to represent the various points of interest along the tour.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Each region is a set of three or more latitude and longitude points that
        define a closed polygon. Using the phone's GPS location, the app needs
        to periodically check to see if the user is standing within one of these
        polygons.
      </p>

      <p>
        To do this, we used an algorithm that draws a ray from the user's
        location to infinity in a random direction. The origin of the ray is
        inside a polygon if the ray passes through an odd number of the
        polygon's line segments (see the <a href="#intersections-diagram">figure
        below</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        This algorithm is rather straightforward and runs in <i>O(n)</i> time,
        where <i>n</i> is the total number of vertices of all polygons being
        tested.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, there is an edge case that could have given us issues. If the
        ray passes exactly through a vertex, the collision algorithm will count
        two intersections instead of just one. Even though this was extremely
        unlikely, we avoided the edge case by subtracting one from the
        intersection count if any vertices were exactly colinear with the ray.
      </p>

      <h3 id="translation-feature">Translation Feature</h3>

      <p>
        ARuko uses augmented reality to translate text on the many Japanese-only
        signs at Kinkaku-ji. We visited the site and took dozens of high quality
        photos of every sign around the walking tour path. A Japanese student
        named Hikaru Inoue provided English translations of each of them. We
        then used the photos to generate Vuforia image targets.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the user points the app at one of these signs, a blue "info" button
        will be overlaid on the image. If the user clicks this button, the
        translation is displayed.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width" style="clear: both">
        <a href="images/aruko-translation-feature.png">
          <img src="images/th_aruko-translation-feature.png" alt="Japanese sign with blue info button over it on the left, with the translation displayed on the right">
        </a>
        <figcaption>
          ARuko's AR translation feature
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        This turned out to be a very intuitive way of delivering high-quality
        translations, and allowed non-Japanese speakers to understand more of
        the cultural and historical significance of Kinkaku-ji.
      </p>

      <figure class="float left">
        <a href="images/aruko-map-overlay.png">
          <img src="images/th_aruko-map-overlay.png" alt="Kinkaku-ji map with path and translated labels">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <h3 id="map-overlay">Map Overlay</h3>

      <p>
        Near the entrance to Kinkaku-ji is a large illustrated map. Much like
        the signage around the site, all of the text on this map is in Japanese
        only. Using the AR camera within the app we can overlay the walking path
        and translations of the labels.
      </p>

      <p>
        The blue path and English text in the figure are not present in the real
        world, they are superimposed onto the camera image by ARuko in real
        time.
      </p>

      <h2 id="editour">Editour&mdash;The Tour Editor</h2>

      <p>
        Alongside ARuko, Cole and I developed a web application called Editour
        to allow a non-technical user to design AR audio tours. Editour allows
        the user to draw arbitrarily-shaped geographic regions onto a map, edit
        those regions, and assign media to each of those regions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The user can upload an audio file and any number of image files for each
        region. The server-side of the application organizes and
        version-controls these files and a definition of the various regions in
        the tour. It serves the most recent version of the tour either as a
        zipped archive or as an editable web page.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/editour.png">
          <img src="images/th_editour.png" alt="Screenshot of the Editour front-end">
        </a>
      </figure>
      <figcaption>A screenshot of the Editour front-end</figcaption>

      <p>
        The user can draw and edit regions of any shape by drawing directly on
        an <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> map.
        Through the menu on the left the user can edit the media files
        associated with each region, as well as uploading new ones.
      </p>

      <h3 id="editour-back-end">Editour Back-End</h3>

      <p>
        I wrote the back-end of the Editour web application using Node.js with
        ECMAScript 2015 (also known as ES6). This allowed us to utilize some of
        the useful new features of the standard, such as modules and promises. I
        wrapped all of the asynchronous methods of the back-end in promises,
        which made error-handling and control flow much easier.
      </p>

      <p>
        Chaining promises with consecutive <code>then()</code> calls is a
        powerful asynchronous technique that is easy to read and understand.
        Consider this snippet from the "<a href="https://github.com/bandaloo/editour/blob/master/endpoints/getTour.js">get tours</a>"
        endpoint:
      </p>

      <code class="block"><span style="color: #5b814a">// read files from the tours directory</span>

  })

    <span style="color: #9cdcfe">logger</span>.<span style="color: #c4c498">log</span>(<span style="color: #ce9178">"Sending file: "</span> + <span style="color: #9cdcfe">zipFile</span>);
    <span style="color: #9cdcfe">res</span>
      .<span style="color: #c4c498">status</span>(200)
      .<span style="color: #c4c498">download</span>(
        <span style="color: #9cdcfe">constants.toursLoc</span> + <span style="color: #9cdcfe">zipFile</span>,
        <span style="color: #9cdcfe">req.params.name</span> + <span style="color: #ce9178">".zip"</span>,
        <span style="color: #9cdcfe">err</span> =&gt; {
          <span style="color: #c586c0">if</span> (<span style="color: #9cdcfe">err</span>) {
            <span style="color: #c586c0">throw</span> <span style="color: #9cdcfe">err</span>;
          }
        }
      );
  })
  .<span style="color: #c4c498">catch</span>(<span style="color: #9cdcfe">errObj</span> =&gt; {

  });</code>

      <p>
        If an error is thrown at any point in the chain, control drops down to
        the <code>catch()</code> clause and an error is returned to the client.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tours are defined by a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> metadata file,
        which contains the GPS coordinates, transcript, name, and files
        associated with each region. This JSON and each of the files is stored
        in a zip file on the server.
      </p>

      <h2 id="extensibility">Extensibility</h2>

      <p>
        The main goal of Editour is to allow ARuko to be extensible. A
        non-technical user, such as our project sponsor, can use Editour to
        easily design new walking tours for other locations, and automatically
        load them into ARuko. We designed the mobile app to accept and parse the
        same zip files generated by Editour, so the integration is seamless.
      </p>

      <p>
        We planned to have ARuko automatically request new tours from the
        Editour server, but didn't have time to implement this feature because
        our sponsor wanted to focus on just the Kinkaku-ji tour.
      </p>

      <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        In three months we were able to create a functional and feature-complete
        application for delivering AR-enhanced audio tours. It was a great
        experience to work on a practical, real-world project for a real
        sponsor, and I learned a lot about the software development process.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was also great to spend three months in Japan, learning about a
        foreign culture's approach to software development and computer science.

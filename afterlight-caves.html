      <p>
        <i>Afterlight Caves</i> is a procedurally generated, top-down twinstick
        shooter game for the web developed by me,
        <a href="https://www.bandaloo.fun" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cole Granof</a>,
        and <a href="https://mattpuentes.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Matt Puentes</a>.
        The gameplay is something like a cross between <i>The Binding of
        Isaac</i> and <i>Geometry Wars</i>, and it runs entirely in a browser.
      </p>

      <p>
        We developed the game over the course of four months, from November 2019
        to March 2020 in our free time. It's made entirely in pure JavaScript,
        with no external front-end libraries. The scripts run directly in a
        browser, and we use a Node.js express server solely to serve the static
        files and keep track of high scores.
      </p>

      <p>
        We wrote all of the game engine and logic from scratch. For graphics we
        just use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JavaScript canvas API</a>
        to draw simple shapes and lines. We run the main game loop and a
        constant speed so the game always runs at your monitor's refresh rate.
        We put a lot of work into optimizing our code, and it runs at a stable
        framerate even on low-powered hardware.
      </p>

      <p>
        The whole thing is also free and open source software, with source code
        available on <a href="https://github.com/bandaloo/afterlight-caves" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Due to the nature of working in a small team we were all involved with
        pretty much every aspect of development, but here are a few of the
        features I focused on.
      </p>

      <h2 id="controls">Controls</h2>

      <p>
        The twinstick genre practically requires the use of a controller with
        two sticks, but we also wanted the game to be playable on a normal
        computer without any specific hardware. To achieve this we needed the
        user to be able to naturally switch between using a keyboard or
        controller on the fly, a surprisingly difficult task in the environment
        of a web browser.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is a rather sophisticated <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API/Using_the_Gamepad_API" rel="noopener noreferrer">gamepad API</a>
        that works with all modern browsers, but unfortunately the way it's
        implemented makes it tricky to use alongside keyboard input.
      </a>

      <p>
        In JavaScript, keyboard input is detected asynchronously through event
        listeners like this:
      </p>

      <code class="block">element.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string" style="color: rgb(181, 189, 104);">"keydown"</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword" style="color: rgb(178, 148, 187);">event</span> =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword" style="color: rgb(178, 148, 187);">if</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword" style="color: rgb(178, 148, 187);">event</span>.key === <span class="hljs-string" style="color: rgb(181, 189, 104);">"a"</span>) console.<span class="hljs-keyword" style="color: rgb(178, 148, 187);">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string" style="color: rgb(181, 189, 104);">"Pressed the 'a' key"</span>);
});</code>

      <p>
        The function you pass to <code>addEventListener()</code> gets
        automatically called whenever a keydown event occurs, which is nice and
        straightforward and easy to deal with.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, detecting gamepad input is done <i>synchronously</i>, which
        means you have to poll the gamepad object to see what buttons are being
        pressed each game step, like so:
      </p>

      <code class="block"><span class="hljs-keyword" style="color: rgb(178, 148, 187);">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword" style="color: rgb(178, 148, 187);">const</span> gamepad <span class="hljs-keyword" style="color: rgb(178, 148, 187);">of</span> navigator.getGamepads()) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword" style="color: rgb(178, 148, 187);">if</span> (!gamepad || !gamepad.connected) <span class="hljs-keyword" style="color: rgb(178, 148, 187);">continue</span>;
  <span class="hljs-keyword" style="color: rgb(178, 148, 187);">if</span> (gamepad.buttons[<span class="hljs-number" style="color: rgb(222, 147, 95);">1</span>].value &gt; <span class="hljs-number" style="color: rgb(222, 147, 95);">0</span> || gamepad.buttons[<span class="hljs-number" style="color: rgb(222, 147, 95);">1</span>].pressed) {
    <span class="hljs-built_in" style="color: rgb(222, 147, 95);">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-string" style="color: rgb(181, 189, 104);">"Gamepad button '1' is pressed"</span>);
  }
}</code>

      <p>
        To combine these two different styles of getting input, I created a
        <a href="https://github.com/bandaloo/afterlight-caves/blob/master/static/modules/buttons.js" rel="noopener noreferrer">buttons module</a>
        that abstracts all input methods into a single object. You can easily
        define any number of Buttons (which represent a single keyboard key or
        gamepad button) and Directionals (which represent a set of four keyboard
        keys or one gamepad joystick). This also makes it easy to rebind keys so
        you can customize controls to your liking.
      </p>

      <p>
        Basically, the <code>buttons</code> object maintains a list of keyboard
        keys, gamepad buttons, and gamepad joysticks it cares about, and keeps
        track of their state. For Buttons this means whether the button is
        pressed during the current game step, and whether it was pressed during
        the last game step (so you can do things when the button is first
        pushed or released). For Directionals it keeps track of the vector
        formed by combining all of its keys or measuring the x and y coordinates
        of its joystick.
      </p>

      <p>
        It has event listeners that fire whenever a key is pressed that check
        whether it's a key we care about and updates the entry for that button.
        Whenever a gamepad button is pressed it switches to gamepad mode, where
        it polls the gamepad each game step and overwrites the entries for each
        button. The next time a keyboard key is pressed it stops overwriting
        until the next time a gamepad is used.
      </p>

      <p>
        Using this system you can seamlessly switch back and forth between using
        a keyboard and gamepad, and even graphically rebind every key through a
        menu.
      </p>

      <h2 id="beam-shooter-enemies">Beam Shooter Enemies</h2>

      <figure class="float right">
        <video loop autoplay controls>
          <source src="images/beam-shooter.webm" type="video/webm">
        </video>
      </figure>

      <p>
        We all worked on each of the seven enemy types in the game, but the one
        I spent the most time on is the Beam Shooters. These enemies slowly move
        in a random cardinal direction and rotate to face the player character
        when it's in range. Unlike all other enemies in the game, the Beam
        Shooter fires a continuous beam rather than a physics-based projectile.
        Implementing this beam required a bit of creative math.
      </p>

      <p>
        The beam cuts straight through entities (like the player character),
        dealing damage and maybe inflicting status effects, but it stops at the
        blocks that make up the walls of the game world.
      </p>

      <p>
        There can be potentially dozens of these beams on the screen at a time,
        and each can have a length as long as the game world itself, so the
        algorithm that calculates a beam's length needs to be efficient.
      </p>

      <p>
        I wrote a <a href="blog/ray-marching-in-a-grid-aligned-world">blog post</a>
        that goes into the design of this algorithm, but the gist is this: start
        from a point in the world (the origin of the beam) and march in a
        direction until you hit a wall. The key observation is that the game
        world is aligned to a grid, so you only need to check for collisions
        with solid blocks at points where the equation of the beam line
        intersects a grid line.
      </p>

      <p>
        This implementation detail ended up being a fun little programming
        challenge with a practical benefit. Drawing beam projectiles is
        efficient enough that you can have many of them on screen at a
        time&mdash;with arbitrary length&mdash;without a noticeable slowdown.
      </p>

      <h2 id="powerup-system">Powerup System</h2>

      <p>
        My favorite part of the project was designing the system of powerups.
        There are 26 different powerups in the game (one for each letter of the
        alphabet), each with a magnitude level from one to five. Every powerup
        is designed to be unique and useful in different ways, and they all
        interact and synergize with each other in interesting ways.
      </p>

      <figure class="float left">
        <video loop autoplay controls>
          <source src="images/afterlight-caves-synergy.webm" type="video/webm">
        </video>
        <figcaption>Synergy between Elastic and Xplode powerups</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        For example, if you pick up an Xplode powerup it makes your bullets
        explode into more bullets. If you pick up an Elastic powerup it makes
        your bullets bounce off walls. If you get both then the elastic effect
        is also applied to the sub-bullets. The powerups are designed in such a
        way that this works for every combination, creating unique play styles
        each time you play.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're curious about this system, I wrote another
        <a href="blog/designing-an-extensible-power-up-system">blog post</a>
        that goes into more detail on the game design and technical decisions
        that went into its design.
      </p>

      <h2 id="conclusion" style="clear: both;">Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        We got to present the game at PAX East 2020 at the WPI booth, which was
        an amazing opportunity. We got some useful playtesting feedback, and it
        was great to talk to other game developers and try out their games.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are many more interesting features I could write about, so perhaps
        I'll post some more about <i>Afterlight Caves</i> on my
        <a href="blog">blog</a> in the future. It was a fun personal project to
        work on, and and it ended up being a fun game that runs on pretty much
        any hardware.

      <h1 class="title">Backpacking Mount Isolation in the rain</h1>

      <p>
        Last weekend I headed out into one of the most remote parts of the
        White Mountain National Forest to climb Mount Isolation via some
        less-used trails. On the two-day trip I experienced pouring rain,
        difficult trails, a bear encounter, and lots of true isolation.
      </p>

      <div id="map-container"></div>

      <h2 id="day-1">Day 1</h2>

      <p>
        I've hiked Mount Isolation on <a href="backpacking-the-southern-presidentials">a
        previous backpacking trip</a>, so this time I wanted to take a longer
        and less popular route. I started the trip at Rocky Branch Trailhead
        South, at the end of Jericho Road in Bartlett NH. When I got to the
        parking lot at 8:00 on Saturday morning there was only one other car,
        which foreshadowed the kind of trip I was about to have.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most of the trip is in the Presidential Range-Dry River Wilderness,
        which is remote and seldom travelled, despite being in the heart of the
        White Mountains. Being a wilderness are, trails are very rugged,
        difficult to follow, and generally unmarked. A perfect way to get away
        from the crowds on a summer weekend.
      </p>

      <p>
        A sign at the trailhead warned me about the current state of Rocky
        Branch Trail. The trail follows an old logging railroad grade that once
        ran alongside the Rocky Branch of the Saco River, but in recent years
        high water from various storms (especially Hurricane Irene in 2011) has
        caused parts of the trail to wash away, and in some places even
        rerouted the whole river.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/rocky-branch-trailhead.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_rocky-branch-trailhead.jpg" alt="Sign at the Rocky Branch Trailhead warning that the trail had changed significantly due to washouts">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Before even beginning the trail proper there was a 1.8-mile road walk
        to do. Jericho Road used to continue to a bridge over the Rocky Branch,
        but that too washed out several years ago. So the Forest Service moved
        the trailhead 1.8 miles up the road, and the last stretch is now closed
        to vehicle traffic indefinitely.
      </p>

      <p>
        The forecast called for rain and possible thunderstorms in the
        afternoon which would continue into Sunday, but for now the weather was
        pleasant, and the gravel road walk went by fast. Soon I was at the
        location of the former bridge.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/rocky-branch-bridge-foundation.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_rocky-branch-bridge-foundation.jpg" alt="This rock foundation is all that remains of the former bridge">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        All that remained was the stone foundation on either side of the river.
        It was easy enough to climb down one side, rock hop across, and
        scramble up the opposing bank. Now the real trail could begin.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next two miles were an easy cruise down an old railroad grade. The
        start of the trail was a good distance from the river, so it was just
        smooth, straight sailing with a very gentle slope and the occasional
        small stream crossing. I made it to the next trail junction before I
        knew it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I checked out the shelter by the intersection.  It's in surprisingly
        good shape despite being over 50 years old, and has some nice views
        overlooking the river. The next leg of my journey would be the biggest
        continuous climb, 1600 feet up over 1.6 miles to Stairs Col. I knew
        once I got up to the col I'd be on the ridgeline where water is scarce,
        so I stocked up and began climbing.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sun was shining and I was starting to sweat. I stopped for a break
        and sat down on a log around 10:00, about half a mile up the Stairs Col
        Trail. As I was eating a protein bar I suddenly realized I could hear
        footsteps nearby, even though I still hadn't seen any other hikers all
        day. I looked around, expecting to see a deer or something in the
        distance.
      </p>

      <p>
        And there, maybe 30 feet in front of me, was a black bear. It took me a
        moment to process, I've hiked hundreds of miles in the Whites and never
        seen a bear until now. It was wandering slowly towards me through the
        woods, sniffing the ground. It clearly hadn't noticed me. Black bears
        tend to avoid people, but they can be aggressive if you startle them. I
        casually called out "hey bear" and it stopped and looked up, directly at me.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bear paused for a long second, then turned around and ran off into
        the woods, back down the slope. After I regained my wits I immediately
        got up and ran the opposite direction up the trail until I was out of
        breath.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/stairs-col-trail.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_stairs-col-trail.jpg" alt="Rock steps on Stairs Col Trail.">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        It was a slightly terrifying experience, but I am glad I finally got to
        see a bear in the wild. I continued up the steep slope and soon made it
        to the intersection with the Davis Path.
      </p>

      <p>
        I had hiked the Davis Path before, so from this point I knew mostly
        what to expect. This is a more popular trail, but still I still hadn't
        seen any other hikers by the time I made it up to Stairs Mountain, the
        first viewpoint of the day. I took a break on the open rock ledges and
        admired the impressive views, along with the approaching rain clouds.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/stairs-view.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_stairs-view.jpg" alt="View from Stairs Mountain, with dark clouds in the distance">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The weather was still fair, but I knew the sky could open up at any
        moment, so I tried to make as much progress as I could before it
        started raining. The Davis Path follows Montalban Ridge up and down
        through some scenic woods until it reaches Mount Isolation, almost 5
        miles north of Stairs, then it continues up the ridge all the way to
        Mount Washington. On my previous trip I had descended the Path from
        Washington, but this time I was turning off it right after Isolation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Around 2:00 PM it finally started pouring rain. I put on my jacket and
        continued up the trail, only about a mile to go until Isolation. When
        it's so warm out, rain isn't such a big deal. You're going to end up
        soaked either way, whether it's from rain or sweat.
      </p>

      <p>
        Eventually I reached the spur for Isolation's summit, over 10 miles
        from where I had started that morning. I scrambled up the last few
        rocky feet to the open summit, where I was greeted by incredible views
        of the Presidential range shrouded in clouds. I didn't stay long or
        take any pictures, because the rain was blowing sideways and I didn't
        want to get hit by lightning on the exposed rock summit.
      </p>

      <p>
        I touched the summit cairn and immediately headed back down. Now I just
        had to get somewhere to camp for the night. I continued .8 miles up the
        trail to the intersection with Isolation Trail East and a campsite I
        had stayed at before. This was one option for camping, but I still had
        plenty of daylight and I wanted to camp closer to a water source, so I
        continued down to the East.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was still pouring rain, and hiking the trail was more like wading
        through a stream at this point. But it was all downhill, easy to
        follow, and not too steep, so I made fast progress. Around 5:00 the
        rain started to let up. I took the opportunity to eat dinner on the
        trail. After that bear encounter I wanted to be especially careful
        about not getting food smells near where I was camping. I had a
        delicious meal of instant ramen with cold water and buffalo-chicken
        flavored tuna, then quickly covered the last mile to the intersection
        with Rocky Branch Trail.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/rocky-branch-stream.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_rocky-branch-stream.jpg" alt="Crossing the Rocky Branch River">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        There was another designated USFS wilderness campsite by the
        intersection, I had already hiked 14 miles, and it was nearly sunset,
        so I decided to stop for the day. Fortunately the rain had fully
        stopped, so I set up my hammock and got ready for bed. I was extra
        careful about hanging my bear bag far away from where I was sleeping,
        just in case.
      </p>

      <p>
        I fell asleep as the rain started drizzling again, having seen one bear
        and zero people all day.
      </p>

      <h2 id="day-2">Day 2</h2>

      <p>
        There was still some light rain in the morning, so I packed up under my
        tarp. Fortunately nothing had gotten to my bear bag at night, and I
        felt well-rested and ready to go.
      </p>

      <p>
        The rest of my schedule was all downhill, following the Rocky Branch
        Trail back to the trailhead. But as that sign warned, following the
        trail was not so easy. Here the railroad grade closely hugged the
        river, and there were lots of spots where it had been washed out
        completely. The trail would just end at a big cliff, and you had to
        figure out whether you were supposed to bushwhack up and around the
        landslide, or climb down to the river and wade downstream until you
        could regain the trail.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maps were basically useless here as they just showed the old course of
        the river and the trail as it used to be, not accounting for all the
        reroutes that are now necessary. It took some guesswork to follow some
        of the detours, and I'm pretty sure I ended up off the official trail
        more than once. Each time I'd eventually find the railroad grade
        further downstream.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/rocky-branch-trail.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_rocky-branch-trail.jpg" alt="A section of the trail that almost washed out, high above the river">
        </a>
        <figcaption>The washout here <i>almost</i> took out the trail, leading to to this cliff</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        This section was challenging, but also really cool. It was amazing to
        see the dramatic changes to the landscape caused by the river. The huge
        land slides, sometimes hundreds of feet high, and vast boulder-strewn
        course of the river were very different from the type of scenery I'm
        used to hiking in. The trail even went through a section that used to
        be an oxbow, but the river cut a new path straight through it, leaving
        behind a U-shaped path of dry boulders.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/rocky-branch.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_rocky-branch.jpg" alt="Rocky Branch River with land slide on the banks">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The rain eventually stopped, and the sun came out. Some of the leaves
        on the trees had already started to change colors and fall, especially
        at higher elevations, which resulted in a very pleasant hike despite
        how difficult it was to follow the trail.
      </p>

      <p>
        After several bushwhacks and rock hops I made it back to the junction
        with Stairs Col Trail, where I had turned off the Rocky Branch Trail
        the day before. Then it was just 3.8 miles of smooth sailing over trail
        I knew back to the car. 
      </p>

      <p>
        It was truly a unique trip, and one I won't ever forget. Over a whole
        summer weekend I didn't see a single other person, encountered a bear,
        and navigated some tricky weather and trail conditions. It was
        difficult at times, but that's the fun of hiking.
      </p>

      <p>
        Total distance: 22 miles, 3500 feet of elevation gain.

      <h1 class="title">Japanese rhythm games: my new addiction</h1>

      <p>
        I've written <a href="audica-and-beat-saber-how-to-do-early-access-right-and-wrong">previously</a>
        about my love of <i>Audica</i> and <i>Beat Saber</i> but those aren't
        the only rhythm games I play. I used to be pretty good at <i>Guitar
        Hero</i>, and I've recently gotten into <i>Stepmania</i>. However,
        studying in Japan has introduced me to the magical world of Japanese
        arcade rhythm games, a new class of game that is threatening to consume
        all my money.
      </p>

      <h2 id="american-arcades">American "arcades"</h2>

      <p>
        Arcades in the U.S. kind of suck. In my experience they tend to be
        small, sketchy, and have a poor choice of games. You'll be lucky to get
        <i>Pac-Man</i> and <i>Galaga</i> along with a slew of low quality mobile
        games on giant screens.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most often you'll just get games you play for tickets, a kind of
        legalized gambling for children, rather than games that are fun enough
        to be worth spending money on for the gameplay alone.
      </p>

      <h2 id="japanese-arcades">Japanese arcades</h2>

      <p>
        Japan on the other hand has arcades down to a science. The first floor
        will usually be long rows of pachinko machines in a huge room that
        smells like smoke and sounds like a jet engine.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/pachinko.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_pachinko.jpg" alt="A row of pachinko machines">
        </a>
        <figcaption>
          I don't understand the appeal of pachinko, but it is apparently <a href="https://fortune.com/2017/01/30/pachinko-japan-gambling-casinos-economy/">very popular</a>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        But beyond that first room designed to trap middle-aged businessmen with
        spare cash in a nostalgia-fueled gambling haze is the good stuff. While
        America's arcades have stagnated and died off since the 1970s, Japan's
        have <a href="https://kotaku.com/why-arcades-havent-died-in-japan-1792338461">continued to thrive</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are a lot of reasons for this general trend, but I think the main
        one is the quality of the games. Japanese arcade game makers actually
        take advantage of the arcade format to design novel experiences you
        wouldn't be able to get anywhere else.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/starwing-paradox.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_starwing-paradox.jpg" alt="An arcade cabinet for
          Starwing Paradox">
        </a>
        <figcaption>
          <i>Starwing Paradox</i>, a game featuring complex joystick and pedal
          controls, two screens, and a seat that moves to simulate flight. Good
          luck playing something like this at home.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Arcade cabinets can have unique hardware that would be too expensive to
        sell to individuals, allowing for almost unlimited creativity in
        interface design. At Japanese arcades you can see tons of new and
        interesting ideas for gameplay that would be impossible anywhere else.
      </p>

      <p>
        And that brings me to the best part of the Japanese arcade experience:
        rhythm games.
      </p>

      <h2 id="rhythm-games">Rhythm games</h2>

      <p>
        Rhythm games are perhaps the genre most able to benefit from the freedom
        of input methods that arcades offer. They've always done well with novel
        control schemes like <i>Beat Saber</i>'s VR swords and <i>Guitar
        Hero</i>'s guitars, and arcade cabinets just bring more options.
      </p>

      <p>
        Take <i>Maimai</i>, a rhythm game by Sega. Its cabinets look kind of
        like a washing machine, with a circular touchscreen on the front
        surrounded by eight buttons.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/maimai.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_maimai.jpg" alt="Arcade cabinets for Maimai">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Or, for something more intuitive, <i>Chunithm</i>: a simple game in
        which you touch the correct notes on a piano-like touch screen in time
        with the music, but it also has motion sensors that allow for inputs
        such as raising your hands and hitting invisible notes in the air.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">

        <figcaption>
          Me playing <i>Chunithm</i> at an arcade near Kyoto
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Chunithm is a personal favorite of mine, but the game I'd recommend the
        most is definitely <i>Taiko no Tatsujin</i>, a game about hitting taiko
        drums. There's something extremely satisfying about hitting giant drums
        to the beat of an anime or Touhou song, and it's very intuitive and easy
        to pick up even if you've never played a rhythm game before.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/taiko-no-tatsujin.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_taiko-no-tatsujin.jpg" alt="A person playing Taiko
          no Tatsujin">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Most games even have a system where you can buy a contactless smart card
        (usually for around 300 yen) to keep track of your progress and high
        scores across multiple plays and locations. Unfortunately the market is
        not very unified and there's a different card for each manufacturer's
        games, so you'll have to pick which ones you like the most or buy
        multiple cards.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although many of these games have official English versions for locales
        such as Hong Kong and South Korea, almost none of them are present in
        the U.S. Whether manufacturers think the American audience won't be
        receptive to these kinds of games or licensing issues prevent their
        export, it's extremely disappointing to think I might never get to
        experience these games again after I leave Japan.
      </p>

      <p>
        I guess I'll just have to spend more time in arcades while I'm still
        here.

        Finally getting some use out of my trackball with <i>Spin Rhythm XD</i>

        I've had a trackball mouse for a couple of years now, and while I like
        it for most casual browsing it is definitely not good for games. You
        just can't match the speed and precision of a real mouse when it comes
        to first person games that require aiming. For pointer-based games like
        <i>Factorio</i> or <i>Cities: Skylines</i> a trackball is about the same
        as a regular mouse. But I may have just found the one game that's
        actually <i>better</i> with a trackball: <i>Spin Rhythm XD</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Spin Rhythm</i> is another rhythm game that I saw at
        <a href="presenting-at-pax-east">PAX East 2020</a> and ended up buying
        later. It's a fairly standard rhythm game with a special control scheme
        as the unique spin. It's designed to be played on a MIDI DJ turntable,
        which you spin, flick, and tap to match the beat. Fortunately it can
        also be played with a mouse and keyboard or controller if you happen to
        not be a DJ.
      </p>

      <p>
        The gameplay is fine with a mouse, but really shines with a trackball.
        Physically flicking the ball back and forth to line up notes and spins
        is a rhythm experience I haven't seen outside of arcades. It's super
        intuitive and tons of fun.
      </p>

      <p>
        The game is in early access, but already has plenty of content. There
        are 30 tracks, each with hand-crafted levels in five difficulties, as
        well as a level editor, online leaderboards, and a multiplayer radio
        mode. The backgrounds and visuals are colorful and exciting without
        being distracting.
      </p>

      <p>
        It took a while to get used to the system of lining up colored notes by
        spinning the wheel rather than just hitting a different button for each
        color, but once I got the hang of it I advanced through normal and hard
        difficulties quite fast. The scoring system is rather generous (as
        western rhythm games usually are), with a relatively generous time range
        to get a "Perfect" for a note and only one lower rank (either "Early" or
        "Late").
      </p>

      <p>
        Even if you don't have a trackball <i>Spin Rhythm</i> is worth checking
        out. It's one of the best PC-exclusive rhythm games I've played
        (although it's supposedly coming to Switch sometime this year), and the
        gameplay flow hooked me right away, and Also, it's only officially on
        Windows and MacOS, but runs perfectly on GNU/Linux using Steam's Proton
        compatibility layer, which is always nice.

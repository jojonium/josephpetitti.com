      <h1 class="title">How accessibility undermines Android's security</h1>

      <p>
        As smartphones become more powerful and ubiquitous the incentives for
        malicious actors to hijack them continue to grow. Gaining access to
        a target's phone can yield bank account passwords, 2-factor
        authentication codes, contacts information, and all kinds of other juicy
        data. Google is constantly trying to protect their platform while still
        giving app developers freedom to make what they want, and for the most
        part they succeed. Applications are generally sandboxed from each other,
        and require granular permissions that users must manually accept in
        order to access hardware and OS resources. But there's one area where
        Android subverts its own strong sanboxing principles: <a
        href="https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6006564?hl=en"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accessibility services</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the name suggests, accessibility services are designed to help users
        with disabilities, and include functionality like screen readers. But in
        order to do this accessibility services need to be able to access all UI
        elements and interactions. This means that any accessibility you have
        enabled can read and interact with <i>anything</i> that appears on your
        phone's screen.
      </p>

      <h2 id="leaking-passwords">Leaking passwords</h2>

      <p>
        Google has put in place a few security protections from these services.
        For example, whenever you type into a text field an accessibility event
        is sent with the new text to any accessibility services. When using
        a password text field, only the transformed characters are sent (so the
        service would only see something like
        <code>&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;</code>).
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/android-password-field.png">
          <img src="images/th_android-password-field.png" alt="Screenshot showing a password field with the last character in plain text">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        But to make passwords easier to type Android shows the last character in
        plain text for 1.5 seconds. The whole visible text is sent as an
        accessibility event every time the text content changes, so the last
        character typed is always sent in plain text. In this way, every
        password you type is leaked to accessibility services one character at a
        time.
      </p>

      <h2 id="enabling-third-party-keyboards">
        Enabling third-party keyboards
      </h2>

      <p>
        The keyboard you're using (or "input method editor" (IME) in
        Android-speak) obviously has access to privileged information, so it can
        normally only be changed manually by the user in the settings app. This
        prevents apps from automatically setting a malicious keyboard as the
        default and using it to steal typed information. However, with an
        accessibility service's ability to simulate user interaction this
        service can install and enable a new IME all by itself without the
        user's knowledge.
      </p>

      <h2 id="tricking-users-into-enabling-accessibility-services">
        Tricking users into enabling accessibility services
      </h2>

      <p>
        Fortunately the only way an app can get access to accessibility events
        is if the user manually enables it as an accessibility service in the
        settings app. The OS displays a dialog box listing all the permissions
        the accessibility service will have access to, and the user must
        manually accept these in order to enable it.
      </p>

      <p>
        To prevent click-jacking attacks where malicious apps would overlay
        false information on top of system pop-ups like these, the Android
        AppOpsManager prevents apps from displaying overlays when permission
        dialogs are open. This is a good step, but it doesn't apply to the new
        "picture-in-picture" feature that allows an app to display videos on top
        of other apps. Attackers could use this to put misleading information on
        top of the permissions dialog, thereby tricking users into enabling a
        rogue accessibility service.
      </p>

      <p>
        In <a href="#kalysch-2018">Kalysch et al.</a> researchers were able to
        trick users with misleading permissions descriptions into enabling an
        accessibility service that recorded UI events from other apps. They also
        discuss social engineering methods to trick users, for example a
        trojaned Google Play app that requires accessibility permissions to
        "function properly."
      </p>

      <h2 id="how-to-protect-yourself">How to protect yourself</h2>

      <p>
        The easiest way is to simply not enable any accessibility services.
        Carefully examine the permissions of each app you install to make sure
        you're not accidentally giving away access to your passwords. Google is
        always working on ways to protect sensitive info from these services,
        but ultimately security comes down to the the responsibility of the end
        user.

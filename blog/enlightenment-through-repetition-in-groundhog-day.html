      <h1 class="title">
        Enlightenment through repetition in <i>Groundhog Day</i>
      </h1>

      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        Although the trope of endlessly repeating the same day has appeared in
        nearly every medium across the world, the most well-known example is
        undoubtedly Harold Ramis's 1993 romantic comedy film <i>Groundhog
        Day</i>. In the film, narcissistic weather reporter Phil Connors, played
        by Bill Murray, is stuck in a time loop, reliving Groundhog Day in
        Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania over and over again. Trapped in a town full of
        local "hicks" and coworkers he hates, Phil first turns to hedonism:
        stealing money from an armored car, eating a comically massive breakfast
        at the town diner, and seducing random women using his temporal
        omniscience. But he soon grows tired of this life and depressed by the
        endless repetition. He tries everything to escape, including elaborate
        suicides and a heist to kidnap the town's groundhog, but each morning he
        wakes up in the same room of the same bed and breakfast, doomed to
        relive the same day again and again.
      </p>

        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Over the course of the film, Phil attempts to pursue a romantic
        relationship with his producer Rita (played by Andie MacDowell), but she
        rebuffs his shallow and manipulative advances. Rita sees through his
        pretend sincerity and rejects him: "I could never love someone like you,
        Phil, because you'll never love anyone but yourself." In the following
        montage we see that each repeated attempt ends the same way: with a
        slap.
      </p>

      <p>
        Eventually, from this constant failure Phil reaches a new understanding
        of life. He dedicates his infinite time to self-improvement and helping
        others. He saves a kid falling out of a tree, nurses an old homeless man
        back to health, performs the Heimlich maneuver on the choking Buster
        Green, and over the course of one day manages to help pretty much
        everyone in town. Through these selfless acts he learns to appreciate
        life and love others, which turns out to be the solution to both of his
        problems. Rita is finally charmed by his new, genuine personality, and
        the next morning Phil wakes up and it's February 3&mdash;he has been
        miraculously freed from hell after attaining enlightenment.
      </p>

      <p>
        This central theme of repetition is reminiscent of Friedrich Nietzsche's
        idea of "eternal recurrence," in which "the eternal hourglass of
        existence is turned over and over and you with it, a mere grain of
        dust."<sup title="Nietzsche (1887), p.273"><a href="#nietzsche-1887">1</a></sup>
        In this post, I examine how this repetition creates a uniquely internal
        quest for self-knowledge, as opposed to the traditional external quest
        to gain some object or conquer some foe.
      </p>

      <h2 id="false-sincerity">False Sincerity</h2>

      <p>
        Phil Connors is an actor, a television personality who delivers weather
        forecasts with his "wickedly sarcastic sense of humor."<sup title="Lavery (1999), p.90"><a href="#lavery-1999">2</a></sup>
        Fakery and charade are his profession, a fact that is made clear from
        the first moment we see him. In this opening scene we watch him act out
        his weather report with mimed actions in front of a blank blue screen
        wall, pretending to interact with the simulated clouds projected on it
        for only him to see.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/groundhog-day-blue-screen.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_groundhog-day-blue-screen.jpg" alt="Phil Connors acts out the weather forecast in front of a blue screen">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        As David Lavery observes, "eternal recurrence enables Phil Connors to
        feign sincerity momentarily, enables him to pretend he cares about
        Rita's deepest values and beliefs&mash;enables him to almost pass for a
        decent human being."<sup title="Lavery (1999), p.93"><a href="#lavery-1999">2</a></sup>
        At first he exploits the time loop to enhance his
        acting abilities, like in the scene where he learns the name of Nancy
        Taylor's high school English teacher, and uses it in the next loop to
        impersonate an old classmate.
      </p>

      <p>
        But these tricks grant Phil only temporary pleasures&mdash;they don't
        help him fulfill his true desire. "Rita's ability to see through him
        returns Phil to square one... Sincerity as an art born of eternal
        recurrence must not exhibit 'a palpable design upon us.'"<sup title="Lavery (1999), p.93"><a href="#lavery-1999">2</a></sup>
        Phil's acting skills cannot bring him true happiness or save him from
        the karmic prison of Punxsutawney, and the realization of this plunges
        him into a suicidal depression. Rita's accusation that "you'll never
        love anyone but yourself" is countered with Phil's first real
        introspective line: "That's not true, I don't even like myself."
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to find love and break free of the supernatural forces that
        force him to repeat the same day again and again, Phil must stop his
        false sincerity and break down the walls of sarcasm and ego he has built
        around himself and achieve self-realization.
      </p>

      <h2 id="inversion-of-the-heros-journey">
        Inversion of the Hero's Journey
      </h2>

      <p>
        In the words of Suzanne Daughton (1996), "What makes <i>Groundhog
          Day</i> significant among contemporary films is that to achieve his
        transformation, Connors must embark on what is traditionally a feminine
        rather than a masculine quest, journeying inward in order to encounter
        and submit to the power of the dark goddess, rather than outward in
        order to master and claim some object in the external world."<sup title="Daughton (1996), p. 140"><a href="#daughton-1996">3</a></sup>
        This journey inward is reflected by the film's setting. Phil is confined
        in a physically small town, in a temporally small slice of time, with no
        real enemies to defeat or treasures to obtain. There is no danger
        either&mdash;Phil cannot die in Punxsutawney. The divine forces that
        want to teach Phil Connors a lesson make it very clear that the answer
        to his problems is not external, but rather within himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        To escape from February 2, Phil cannot rely on the defenses he
        knows&mdash;the fakery he uses to clumsily court Rita or the brute force
        he uses to smash the alarm clock and kill the groundhog (both merely
        symbols of his imprisonment, not the cause). At the end of the second
        act he has an enlightening conversation with Rita where for the first
        time he speaks to her as a human being, not as a coworker he holds in
        contempt or merely a sexual goal to pursue.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/groundhog-day-cards.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_groundhog-day-cards.jpg" alt="Phil and Rita laugh together in bed in a rare moment of shared happiness">
        </a>
        <figcaption>
          Phil teaches Rita to flip cards as they speak for the first time as
          friends.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        This moment isn't enough to free Phil from Punxsutawney, but he knows
        what he has to do now. Following Rita's advice, he turns his knowledge
        towards helping people of the town and bettering himself. "He has shown
        sincere appreciation for Rita and the qualities he once ridiculed."<sup title="Daughton (1996), p. 149"><a href="#daughton-1996">3</a></sup>
        The next scenes show a Phil dedicated to goodness for its own sake. He
        runs to catch a boy falling out of a tree, jokingly scolding him "what
        do you say? You little brat, you have never thanked me!" He knows the
        boy will wake up fine the next day regardless of his actions, but he
        still rushes to catch him anyway, unthanked and unadmired. He masters
        ice sculpting and playing the piano. At the Groundhog Day party Phil
        looks genuinely happy and fulfilled for the first time in the film. "He
        has found his purpose serving others, and has achieved a complete
        transformation of the self he despised."<sup title="Daughton (1996), p. 150"><a href="#daughton-1996">3</a></sup>
      </p>

      <h2 id="enlightenment">Enlightenment</h2>

      <p>
        By the end of the film the only thing that Phil has really conquered is
        his old self. In fact, "rather than resenting his trip to Punxsutawney
        each year, or even being understandably eager to leave after his forced
        stay, Connors has become so fond of the town and its beauty that he
        wants to remain."<sup title="Daughton (1996), p. 151"><a href="#daughton-1996">3</a></sup>
        The introspection from being forced to repeat the same day gives him a
        real appreciation for life and a new, genuine sincerity.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's no mistake that the only image of the divine we see in the film is
        Phil's ice sculpture of an angel near the end. Like this angel, Phil's
        truth and guidance come from within. Having journeyed within and
        returned with kindness, humility, and an appreciation for the ordinary
        days and people he experiences, Phil is finally permitted to return to
        the real world and the normal passage of time.

      <h1 class="title">Quines in JavaScript</h1>

      <p>
        Because programmers have nothing better to do with their free time, they
        often amuse themselves by finding clever solutions to difficult logic
        problems. One such problem is called a "quine," and it goes something
        like this: write the shortest possible program the prints its own source
        code.
      </p>

      <p>
        It would be trivial to just read the file that the program is saved as
        and output that, but most programmers would consider this to be
        cheating. With this restriction in place creating quines becomes an
        interesting challenge that is more complicated than it initially
        appears.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you've never tried to create a quine in your favorite programming
        language, I highly recommend you try it before reading further. There's
        something magical about figuring out how to do it for the first time.
        Spend some time tinkering until you solve it, then come back here.
      </p>

      <p>
        Don't look below this turtle burger if you don't want me to spoil your
        discovery by telling you how to make a quine.
      </p>

          This image hides the rest of the article so you don't get spoilered if
          you haven't created your own quine yet
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Here's the first quine I made today, in JavaScript:
      </p>

      <code class="block">s=console.log;r=x=&gt;x.replace(/\\/g,"\\\\").replace(/"/g,"\\\"");u="s(\"s=console.log;r=\"+r+\";u=\\\"\"+r(u)+\"\\\";\"+u);";s("s=console.log;r="+r+";u=\""+r(u)+"\";"+u);</code>

      <p>
        The actual program doesn't have any newlines, but here it is broken up
        into separate statements with some syntax highlighting to make it easier
        to read:
      </p>

      <code class="block"><span style="color: #d0d0d0">s=console.log;</span>
<span style="color: #d0d0d0">r=x=&gt;x.replace(</span><span style="color: #3066be">/\\/g</span><span style="color: #d0d0d0">,</span><span style="color: #f1a208">&quot;\\\\&quot;</span><span style="color: #d0d0d0">).replace(</span><span style="color: #3066be">/&quot;/g</span><span style="color: #d0d0d0">,</span><span style="color: #f1a208">&quot;\\\&quot;&quot;</span><span style="color: #d0d0d0">);</span>
<span style="color: #d0d0d0">u=</span><span style="color: #f1a208">&quot;s(\&quot;s=console.log;r=\&quot;+r+\&quot;;u=\\\&quot;\&quot;+r(u)+\&quot;\\\&quot;;\&quot;+u);&quot;</span><span style="color: #d0d0d0">;</span>
<span style="color: #d0d0d0">s(</span><span style="color: #f1a208">&quot;s=console.log;r=&quot;</span><span style="color: #d0d0d0">+r+</span><span style="color: #f1a208">&quot;;u=\&quot;&quot;</span><span style="color: #d0d0d0">+r(u)+</span><span style="color: #f1a208">&quot;\&quot;;&quot;</span><span style="color: #d0d0d0">+u);</span></code>

      <p>
        At 170 characters in length this is definitely not the shortest
        possible, but I think it's not bad for a first attempt. Let's walk
        through how it works.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first statement just sets a one letter variable to equal the
        function <code>console.log</code>, so that I don't have to retype it
        later. Normally in JavaScript you declare variables with
        <code>let</code> or <code>const</code>, but you don't actually need to.
        It will still run just fine as long as you're not in strict mode.
      </p>

      <p>
        Line 2 declares an arrow function that takes an argument,
        <code>x</code>, and performs two regular expression find and replace
        operations on it. It replaces a single backslash with two backslashes,
        and a quotation mark with <code>\"</code>. This essentially "unescapes"
        a string, and will be useful later.
      </p>

      <p>
        The third line is a complex and ugly string containing a bunch of
        escaped quotation marks and backslashes. This is the contents of the
        final <code>console.log</code> as a JavaScript string.
      </p>

      <p>
        The final line actually calls <code>console.log</code>, printing the
        source code. When the function <code>r</code> is concatenated onto a
        string literal, JavaScript calls the <code>Function.toString()</code>
        method on it to coerce it into being a string. This inserts the source
        code of <code>r</code> into the string that is printed. Finally,
        <code>r(u)</code> unescapes the string <code>u</code> so it is printed
        with backslashes exactly as it appears in the source code.
      </p>

      <p>
        This quine works, but it's still a little long. With a bit more time I
        managed to shorten it to 130 characters:
      </p>

      <code class="block">r=x=&gt;x.replace(/(["\\])/g,"\\$1");u="console.log(\"r=\"+r+\";u=\\\"\"+r(u)+\"\\\";\"+u)";console.log("r="+r+";u=\""+r(u)+"\";"+u)</code>

      <p>
        Once again, here's a version with newlines and syntax highlighting so
        it's easier to read:
      </p>

      <code class="block"><span style="color: #d0d0d0">r=x=&gt;x.replace(</span><span style="color: #3066be">/([&quot;\\])/g</span><span style="color: #d0d0d0">,</span><span style="color: #f1a208">&quot;\\$1&quot;</span><span style="color: #d0d0d0">);</span>
<span style="color: #d0d0d0">u=</span><span style="color: #f1a208">&quot;console.log(\&quot;r=\&quot;+r+\&quot;;u=\\\&quot;\&quot;+r(u)+\&quot;\\\&quot;;\&quot;+u)&quot;</span><span style="color: #d0d0d0">;</span>
<span style="color: #d0d0d0">console.log(</span><span style="color: #f1a208">&quot;r=&quot;</span><span style="color: #d0d0d0">+r+</span><span style="color: #f1a208">&quot;;u=\&quot;&quot;</span><span style="color: #d0d0d0">+r(u)+</span><span style="color: #f1a208">&quot;\&quot;;&quot;</span><span style="color: #d0d0d0">+u)</span></code>

      <p>
        The first line is completely removed from this version, because I
        realized it's shorter to just type out <code>console.log</code> twice.
        The function <code>r</code> is shortened by combining the two
        <code>replace()</code> calls into one, using a more complicated regular
        expression that does the same thing as the two previous ones.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because of these changes <code>u</code> is shorter, and I removed the
        final semicolon from the end because it isn't strictly required.
      </p>

      <p>
        I thought this was the shortest I could get this quine to be, but after
        another couple hours of playing with it I was able to cut it all the way
        down to just 35 characters. Behold the shortest JavaScript quine I could
        come up with:
      </p>

      <code class="block">r=x=&gt;console.log(<span style="color: #f1a208">`r=</span><span style="color: #3066be">${r}</span><span style="color: #f1a208">;r()`</span>);r()</code>

      <p>
        I had a hunch the power of <code>Function.toString()</code> could be
        abused to create a very short quine, and it turned out to be right.
      </p>

      <p>
        First, <code>r</code> is declared as an arrow function. Note that it
        takes one argument, even though this argument is never used. This is
        because <code>r=x=&gt;...</code> is one character shorter than
        <code>r=()=&gt;...</code> and still just as valid. Because all function
        parameters are optional in non-strict JavaScript we don't even need to
        pass anything to <code>r</code> when we call it later.
      </p>

      <p>
        If an arrow function is only one statement you can omit the curly braces
        around the body, so the body of this function is just the
        <code>console.log</code> call. Once again <code>r</code> is converted
        into a string through type coercion, this time by inserting it into a
        template literal. At the end of the line <code>r()</code> is actually
        called, causing our output to be printed.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is the shortest JavaScript quine I could think of. A quick search
        revealed that some very clever people have come up with even shorter
        ones, but I think 35 characters is still a pretty good score.

      </h2>

      <p>
        You can make quines in almost any programming language, and even some
        things that aren't really programming languages.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, it's <a href="https://research.swtch.com/zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">possible</a>
        to make a quine out of a Lempel-Ziv compressed data stream, the format
        used to define zip files. This means you can create a
        <a href="/assets/r.zip">zip file</a> that recursively contains an
        infinite number of copies of itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's a neat shell script quine:
      </p>

      <code class="block">#!/bin/cat</code>

      <p>
        If you make this script executable and run it, the shebang indicates
        that the program it should be run with is <code>cat</code>. This
        obviously just prints the file to the stdout, technically making it a
        correct quine.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, here's a quine I wrote in Haskell. It's not very good, but it
        does work:
      </p>

      <code class="block">module Main where

main = do putStr (s ++ (show s) ++ <span style="color: #f1a208">"\n"</span>)
       where s = <span style="color: #f1a208">"module Main where\n\nmain = do putStr (s ++ (show s) ++ \"\\n\")\n       where s = "</span></code>
    </main>

      <h1 class="title">How to take beautiful notes with Pandoc</h1>

      <p>
        Taking notes by hand is so old fashioned. You can't version control or
        backup paper, it's hard to search through, and a small mistake can force
        you to cross out or erase a whole line of text. But taking good notes on
        a computer has a host of problems of its own. Fiddling with formatting
        and typesetting is time-consuming, and it's hard to include mathematical
        notation, images, and other elements that are easy to write by hand but
        hard to type. Fortunately, I've found a solution that's easy and fun to
        use: writing Markdown and compiling it to a LaTeX-produced PDF with
        Pandoc. Read on to learn how I do it.

      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LaTeX</a> is indisputably
        the king of math and science typesetting, but it's cumbersome to use for
        basic tasks like note-taking. Writing out a whole LaTeX preamble for a
        every document is more work than is needed for something this simple.
        Instead, I write my notes in a super simple markup language called
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Markdown</a>. If you
        don't already know Markdown, spend two minutes reading
        <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this page</a>
        and you'll know everything you need to. The nice thing about Markdown,
        as opposed to other markup languages like HTML or YAML is that it's
        already pretty readable as plain text. But we want our notes, and
        especially our notes, to look better than "pretty readable."
      </p>

      <p>
        We'll use a lovely program called
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandoc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pandoc</a> to convert our
        okay-looking Markdown notes to beautiful PDF notes. Pandoc is free
        software written in Haskell, so installing it is easy. On a Fedora
        system, just do:
      </p>

      <code class="block"># dnf install pandoc</code>

      <p>
        See <a href="https://pandoc.org/installing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> if you need
        more help installing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pandoc converts between many different types of documents, among them
        being Markdown files and PDFs. For creating PDFs Pandoc uses LaTeX as
        its backend, so you get the professional look of TeX without having to
        actually write it.
      </p>

      <p>
        This does mean that it relies on a a TeX backend, so install one if you
        don't already have one. For example:
      </p>

      <p>
        Now we can convert our markdown to beautiful PDFs with one command:
      </p>

      <code class="block">$ pandoc -s -o notes.pdf notes.md</code>

      <p>
        The <code>-o</code> flag tells Pandoc the filename and format to output
        to, and the <code>-s</code> flag stands for "standalone" (create a full
        file instead of just a snippet).
      </p>

      <code class="block"># dnf install texlive-latex</code>

      <p>
        "But wait!" you say. "Markdown is nice, but what about math mode and
        those other neat features from LaTeX?" Fear not. Pandoc supports many
        Markdown extensions like <code>tex_math_dollars</code> out of the box.
        (See <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_pandoc_markdown.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>
        for a full list of supported extensions).
      </p>

      <p>
        Anything between two dollar signs will be treated as TeX math by the
        Pandoc compiler. So this:
      </p>

      <code class="block">$\min \{ \pi(w), \pi(v) + l_e \}$</code>

      <p>
        Becomes this:
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This</a> is a
        great resource on mathematics in LaTeX that I'd recommend looking
        through.
      </p>

      <p>
        This method is what I use for taking notes in my computer science
        classes. It lets me write quickly during class, but compiles to
        beautifully-typeset PDFs that are great for studying later. Pandoc is
        also an incredibly useful tool with tons more features that I haven't
        covered here, so I'd recommend looking into it more if you do any large
        amount of writing.

      <h1 class="title">The underrated brilliance of <i>American Psycho</i></h1>

        I've seen <a href="https://letterboxd.com/jojonium">a
        lot of movies</a>, and Mary Harron's 2000 psychological thriller
        <i>American Psycho</i> is one of my favorites of all time. Yet for some
        reason it seems like this masterpiece has mostly flown under the radar,
        seen as a curious but shallow origin of memes, and remembered with a
        casual "oh yeah, that was alright." This lack of acclaim for a film I
        rank among the likes of <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> and <i>The End of
        Evangelion</i> is great injustice in my eyes, so I will try to explain
        what I like so much about it. Be warned, there be spoilers here, so for
        the best experience go watch the film first and come up with your own
        explanations, then come back and read this.
      </p>

      <h2 id="what-makes-it-good">What makes it good?</h2>

      <p>
        <i>American Psycho</i> is the rare type of movie that works on every
        level. If you turn off your brain and just view it as a dark comedy
        about Christian Bale being insane and killing people, it's excellent. If
        you delve deeper and look at it as a look through the eyes of a deeply
        mentally disturbed individual struggling to control his murderous sexual
        urges, it's excellent. If you go even deeper and see it as a commentary
        on the uncaring, unfeeling, self-absorbed world of the business elite,
        it's excellent. It just works on every level, never failing to be both
        entertaining and thought provoking.
      </p>

      <p>
        From a technical standpoint <i>American Psycho</i> almost perfect. There
        are a few small flaws, like Patrick's phone ringing only once before
        going to voicemail while he's at his apartment with Jean, or
        "Acquisitions" being spelled wrong on every business card, but as a
        whole it's a solidly made film.
      </p>

          This one is also missing a space after the ampersand in "Pierce &amp;
          Pierce"
        </figcaption>

      <p>
        The 
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144084/soundtrack">soundtrack</a>
        is full of out-of-place upbeat 80s pop songs, which perfectly fit the
        vapid, consumerist nature of the characters (which I'll discuss more
        below).
      </p>

      <figure class="float right">
        <p class="quote">Can you keep it down? I'm trying to do drugs</p>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The writing is also brilliant. <i>American Psycho</i> has to be one of
        the most quotable movies I've seen. Each line is carefully crafted, and
        tells you something important about the character and the way they view
        the world. When, in a rare emotional moment, Courtney asks Patrick "Can
        we talk?" he looks at her for a minute and responds with "You look...
        marvelous. There's nothing to say." The  line shows Bateman's
        disdain for her as a person, but also shows his assumption that if a
        woman wants to talk to him it must have to do with how she looks,
        mirroring an earlier conversation with Jean.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's also just really funny. From Patrick's detailed discussions of Phil
        Collins and Huey Lewis and the News to Bryce's idiotic claim that "like,
        the Sikhs are killing tons of Israelis over there" in Sri Lanka,
        <i>American Psycho</i> is a top-tier comedy that doesn't need to
        sacrifice its message to be entertaining.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, while the cinematography isn't quite as beautiful as the likes
        of <i>Barry Lyndon</i> or <i>2001</i>, there are still some great shots.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p>
        And of course there's the acting. Christian Bale is excellent in
        the lead role, but many of the minor characters also have great
        performances. Willem Dafoe's incompent but creepy Detective Donald
        Kimball, Jared Leto's enviable Paul Allen, and Chloe Sevigny's
        often-harassed Jean are all memorably portrayed.
      </p>

      <h2 id="what-does-it-all-mean">What does it all mean?</h2>

      <p>
        Now for some analysis. Patrick Bateman is the personification of late
        80s materialism. He quotes album reviews and restaurant critics verbatim
        from memory, and his entire personality is based on brands and products.
        In his opening monologue, we learn where he lives before we even learn
        his name. The only thin that actually scares Bateman in the movie is the
        realization that Paul Allen's apartment is nicer than his.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/american-psycho-phil-collins.jpg">

      </figure>

      <figure class="float left">
        <p class="quote">I even, um... I ate some of their brains...</p>
      </figure>

      <p>
        He is the ultimate consumer, to the point that he literally
        <i>consumes</i> people. But he is not unique in this. Everyone at Pierce
        &amp; Pierce dresses the same, talks the same, and buys the same things.
        They all do nothing at work but go out to lunch and show off their
        business cards. Bateman is a kind of sociopathic alien outsider,
        observing the world of rich yuppies and simply trying to copy it. As he
        tells Evelyn, his supposed fiancé, he keeps the job "Because I want to
        fit in."
      </p>

      <p>
        Bateman does all the same things as Bryce, Van Patten, and McDermott, he
        just takes them a a little too far. Everyone is so self-absorbed, only
        focused on themselves and their own lives, that they don't notice what's
        going on around them. Because everyone just wants to "fit in," they all
        end up looking identical.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/american-psycho-3.jpg">

        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        In the first scene, Bryce mistakes someone else for Paul Allen. Allen
        mistakes Bateman for Halberstram. A Stephen Hughes claimed he saw Allen
        at a restaurant in London, but "he mistook a Herbert Ainsworth for
        Paul." The real Marcus Halberstram claimed he had dinner with Bateman on
        the night of Paul's disappearance, but he was mistaken. Harold Carnes
        mistakes Bateman for someone named Davis. Carnes also says he had lunch
        with Paul Allen London, but did he really? No one can tell anyone apart,
        and they don't really care.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <p class="quote block">Allen has mistaken me for this dickhead, Marcus
        Halberstram. It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&amp;P, and
        in fact does the exact thing I do. He also has a penchant for Valentino
        suits and Oliver Peoples glasses. Marcus and I even go to the same
        barber, although I have a slightly better haircut.</p>
      </figure>

      <p>
        No one in the film (except maybe Jean) cares about anything but
        their own life. Bateman confesses four times to four different people,
        and all four times they either weren't listening or dismissed it as a
        joke right away.
      </p>

      <p>
        The real truth of <i>American Psycho</i> is that Patrick Bateman gets
        away with murder not because he's a criminal mastermind, but because
        everyone else is too selfish to notice or care.

      <h1 class="title"><i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> is what VR games should be</h1>

      <p>
        Thirteen years after <i>Episode 2</i>, Valve finally returns to the
        Half-Life universe with a VR-exclusive prequel titled <i>Half-Life:
        Alyx</i>. You play as resistance member Alyx Vance in between the events
        of the first and second game, attempting to fight the brutal alien
        combine enslaving Earth. The game is designed for Valve's new
        <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Index</a> headset, but
        will work with any PC VR headset on the market. Expectations were
        understandably high for the long-awaited continuation of the Half-Life
        franchise, but <i>Alyx</i> more than lives up to them, setting a new
        standard for VR gameplay.
      </p>

        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        As a relatively new technological platform, the VR game marketplace has
        long been dominated by tech demos, proofs of concept, and "VR
        experiences" that amount to little more than a glorified walking
        simulator. Even the few exceptional games, like <i>Beat Saber</i> and
        <i>Robo Recall</i> are generally small and simple compared to
        conventional AAA games. <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> is the first game I've
        played on my Oculus to actually feel "full-sized." I finished the
        story in about 12 hours, taking my time to explore each area, and I'm
        sure I didn't find everything.
      </p>

      <p>
        The gameplay is also some of the best I've seen in VR. The game uses
        continuous locomotion with a joystick, as well as teleportation-based
        movement for those prone to motion sickness. Traversing environments,
        climbing ladders, and peering around corners all work flawlessly, and I
        soon stopped noticing the locomotion at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        Interacting with the environment is where <i>Alyx</i>'s gameplay really
        shines. Rummaging through boxes, open drawers, and grabbing objects
        feels more natural in this than any other game I've played. The new
        physics system in the Source 2 engine is really incredible. Everything
        behaves the way you'd expect, and it creates this amazing believable
        feel to the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the game's unique features is the "gravity gloves," which you can
        use to sort of fling distant objects toward yourself. At first this
        mechanic felt a little awkward, but after doing it literally twice it
        suddenly clicked. From that point on it felt as natural as anything: see
        a full pistol magazine on the other side of the room, point your hand at
        it, and with a flick of the wrist it comes flying toward you for you to
        catch. It's incredibly fun to do, and saves you from having to bend down
        to grab stuff off the floor all the time.
      </p>

        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The gunplay also feels really satisfying. Instead of just pressing a
        button to reload you have to manually eject the empty magazine from your
        pistol, or feed shells into your shotgun. It's a neat feature that adds
        to the realism of the game and feels cool to do. Actually aiming and
        firing the guns is perfectly fine, but that's something VR has always
        been good at.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was a bit disappointed in the weapon variety on display. You get a
        basic pistol, shotgun, and SMG, and that's it. No .357 Magnum, no pulse
        rifle, no rocket launcher, no two-handed weapons at all actually. Most
        glaringly absent is any kind of melee attack. How can a Half-Life game
        not have a crowbar? Despite the environments being full of realistic
        physics objects, they all just bounce ineffectively off of enemies. When
        you run out of ammo (which you likely will in the early game when
        bullets are scarce) all you can do it run away and hope to stumble upon
        a spare shotgun shell before the zombies get you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fortunately VR brings some new combat opportunities to the table.
        Nothing beats the feeling of catching a leaping headcrab out of the air
        and flinging it through a nearby window. VR's full range of motion
        allows you to use cover more effectively, crouching behind concrete
        barriers and peering out to shoot at Combine grunts. You can even use
        the gravity gloves to catch live grenades out of the air and throw them
        back, an action which is simultaneously satisfying and terrifying.
      </p>

      <p>
        The game looks great too, with Half-Life's classic art style brought to
        modern graphical standards. I particularly liked all the new Combine
        technology we get to see and interact with. Dark tunnels filled with
        venom headcrabs are far more scary in virtual reality, and the excellent
        sound design and soundtrack only add to this.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p>
        I won't go into the story much so as to avoid spoilers, but it's what
        you would expect from a Valve game. Although it's a prequel you to have
        to play all the other Half-Life games first, as it spoils the ending of
        <i>Episode 2</i> in the first 10 seconds. I liked all the characters,
        especially the newly introduced resistance scientist Russell, I just
        wish there were more of them. You spend most of the game just talking to
        one guy, which makes the world feel kind of barren.
      </p>

      <p>
        I unfortunately had to play on my old-ish PC and original Oculus Rift
        headset, which meant "low fidelity" graphics and occasional crashes
        (when they recommend 12 GiB of RAM they really mean it). Still,
        <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> is one of the best VR games I've played, and sets
        a new standard for gameplay design in virtual reality. I had a blast
        with it, and I hope that it will lead to increased interest and
        development in the world of VR from other game studios.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now we just need VR <i>Left 4 Dead</i> and <i>Portal</i> games.

      <p>
        This term I decided to branch out from my usual computer science
        courseload and try out a class from a very similar department:
        Interactive Media and Game Development. To that end I took a class
        called "Artificial Intelligence in Interactive Media and Games," which
        turned out to be a lot of fun. (It's also nice that it counts for CS
        credit).
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the projects I did for the class was to use various AI techniques
        to build a generator for Super Mario Bros. levels, and an agent that can
        appear human while playing them. A partner and I used
        <a href="https://github.com/amidos2006/Mario-AI-Framework">Ahmed
        Khalifa</a>'s Mario AI framework to implement these systems in Java, and
        they both ended up working pretty well.
      </p>

      <h2 id="phase-1-the-level-generator">Phase 1: the level generator</h2>

      <p>
        We used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov
        chain</a> model to generate new Mario levels from inputs of existing
        ones, both from the games and created by other generators. It reads in
        level files from a specified directory, parses each vertical column
        of blocks into a "slice," and adds it to a Markov chain transition
        table. Basically each unique slice has a list of which slices follow it,
        and the probability that it is followed by that specific slice.
      </p>

      <p>
        To generate a level, it picks a random slice to start with, then picks
        another to follow it based on the transition table, and so on. This
        continues until the generator selects a slice with a flag in it or
        reaches the desired level length.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, the Markov chain-based generator worked decently, and managed
        to make some nice-looking levels when given the original Super Mario
        Bros. maps as input:
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">

          alt="A Mario level generated by our algorithm">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The main weakness of this type of level generator is one of the main
        properties of Markov chains: memorylessness. The decision of which slice
        to select is based only on the previous slice. This means there's no way
        for the generator to tell if it's making pits that are too wide to jump
        across or a long row of boring nothingness.
      </p>

      <h2 id="phase-2-the-ai-agent">Phase 2: the AI agent</h2>
      
      <p>
        For this phase of the project we tried to create an agent that could
        successfully navigate Mario levels while convincing viewers that a human
        was playing. Although it would be easy to implement an A* algorithm that
        always makes it to the flag, we wanted it to look like a flawed human
        was behind the controller, which is a much more difficult task. We
        implemented a decision-tree AI system to do this, since this type of
        model can provide complex behavior while being easy to understand and
        debug.
      </p>

      <p>
        We created a basic tree data structure with two types of
        nodes&mdash;action and question nodes. At a question node, the agent
        makes some kind of decision based on information it has about the
        environment. For example, whether Mario is standing next to a pit or
        not. Action nodes are the leaves of the tree, representing the action
        taken after a series of decisions. For example, if Mario is standing on
        the ground and there is an enemy to the right he might take the action
        "jump right."
      </p>

      <p>
        Using basic decisions and actions as building blocks we constructed a
        decision tree that would be executed each game step to get the next
        action for our agent to take. We incrementally tweaked the shape and
        nodes of the tree until we got an agent that looks almost human while
        playing a level:
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <video src="images/mario.mp4" controls>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Our agent ended up being not terrible, but it probably could have been a
        lot better. It turns out that decision trees aren't a great choice for
        this type of problem for the same reason Markov chains aren't the best
        at designing levels: they don't have any memory. Because the same tree
        has to be run every game step, it's difficult to do complex actions like
        long jumps because the tree doesn't hold a global state.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, it was still a fun project even though the design decisions we
        chose turned out to not be the most optimal. I learned a lot about
        procedural generation that I would later put to use in a JavaScript
        rogue-lite game I'm working on, and had fun experimenting with different
        AI techniques.

        The corrupting influence of television in <i>Network</i>
      </h1>

      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        Sidney Lumet's 1976 classic <i>Network</i> ends with a blunt summary of
        its plot: "This was the story of Howard Beale, the first known instance
        of a man who was killed because he had lousy ratings." While the life
        and death of network news anchorman Howard Beale (played by Peter Finch)
        is certainly an important part of the film, it's telling that Beale's
        actor is third billed in what is ostensibly his own story. Howard, along
        with most of the other characters in the film, is simply along for the
        ride, unable to influence or control the true focus of the film: the
        destructive power of television.
      </p>

        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The film starts on a macabre note. Howard Beale, a newscaster past his
        prime working for failing television network UBS has just been
        firedâ€”effective in two weeks. Howard's old friend and head of the news
        department at UBS, Max Shumacher (William Holden), breaks the news to
        him, and they both go out to get "properly pissed." Max relates a story
        from his youth in which a cab driver mistakenly assumes he is suicidal
        as he rushes to get to an on-site newscast from the middle of the George
        Washington bridge. The two friends' uproarious laughter fills the dark
        New York City street. This suicide as entertainment bit is echoed later,
        as a morose Howard claims "I'm gonna blow my brains out right on the
        air. Right in the middle of the 7:00 news." Max replies "Well, you'll
        get a hell of a rating."
      </p>

      <p>
        The next day Beale repeats the same statement, this time on live
        television. The world is shocked and appalled. Reporters surround the
        UBS building. Phones ring off the hook with complaints about foul
        language. Howard is hauled into the office of network executive Frank
        Hackett (Robert Duvall) and told that he's off the air effective
        immediately. He begs to be allowed one last show, to apologize and make
        a farewell statement, and the boss eventually acquiesces to his pleas.
        Once he's live, however, instead of gracefully retiring with a dignified
        apology, he goes berserk, telling audiences in graphic terms that he is
        fed up and has nothing more to say.
      </p>

      <p>
        Management is furious, but one woman sees a lucrative opportunity in the
        scandal: the young and ruthless head of programming Diana Christensen,
        played by Faye Dunaway. She has a single-minded devotion to creating a
        hit program to bring the network out of its slump, no matter the social
        or moral implications. "Audience share and ratings are the alpha and
        omega of her existence."<sup title="Trier (2006), p.233"><a href="#trier-2006">1</a></sup>
        She is, as Max later pointedly observes, "television incarnate." She
        sees the ratings shoot up thanks to Beale's new persona, and convinces
        Hackett to keep him on.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point Howard experiences some kind of spiritual vision&mdash;or
        perhaps he just has a mental breakdown, the film is deliberately
        ambiguous on this point. Either way, he hears a voice tell him to go on
        the air and preach the truth to the people. "We're not talking about
        eternal or absolute or ultimate truth," the voice says, "we're talking
        about impermanent, transient, human truth." So that's what he does.
      </p>

      <h2 id="the-corruption-of-the-prophet">The corruption of the prophet</h2>
      
      <p>
        When Howard gets back on the air, he begins an angry tirade against the
        madness and injustice of the modern world. "Open the window, stick your
        head out and yell: 'I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it any
        more!'" he commands his audience. "Howard Beale is, indeed, a modern
        Moses, telling us that we are in bondage to the TV slave masters, who in
        turn crack the whip at the bidding of Exxon, Dupont, and other
        multinational Pharaohs."<sup title="Elliot (1977), p.74"><a href="#elliot-1977">2</a></sup>
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">

          <img src="images/th_network-1.jpg" alt="Howard Beale rails against the modern world on his nightly news show">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Audiences love it. As ratings continue to rise the network executives
        give Beale his own show with other eccentric personalities. He is
        introduced as the Mad Prophet of the Airwaves, and preaches his gospel
        to a live studio audience. But things take a turn for the worse when
        Beale turns his righteous anger towards the very institution that is
        that is supporting him: television. "Television is not the truth.
        Television is a goddamned amusement park," he says. "You're beginning to
        think the tube is reality and that your own lives are unreal." For his
        sin of attempting to expose the evil influence of television the prophet
        is summoned before Arthur Jensen, the the chairman of UBS's parent
        company.
      </p>

      <p>
        The conference room where they meet is huge and dark, designed to evoke
        an "overwhelming cathedral".<sup title="Itzkoff (2014a), p.119"><a href="#itzkoff-2014a">3</a></sup>
        Jensen calls it Valhalla. As theologian
        Clifford Elliott observes, "The movie shows in a disturbing way how
        religious and liturgical the business world can be."<sup title="p.75"><a href="#elliot-1977">2</a></sup>
        In contrast to Howard's earlier spiritual vision, which was personal and
        silent (at least to us viewers), this religious experience is terrifying
        and deafening. Jensen is framed equally as a hellfire preacher, pointing
        his finger from the end of the table and roaring "You will atone!", and
        as a devil, slinking through the darkness, partially obscured by a row
        of green desk lamps. Beale is tempted by the devil's slick words, and
        eventually succumbs to them. "I have seen the face of God" he cries, to
        which Jensen replies "You just might be right."
      </p>

        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        From that night on Howard Beale preaches the corporate cosmology of
        Arthur Jensen. Television and its mastersâ€”IBM, ITT, AT&amp;T, Dupont,
        Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon, to name a fewâ€”have corrupted even Howard
        Beale.
      </p>

      </h2>

      <p>
        Howard Beale was not particularly attached to any great cause or
        political philosophy before his "cleansing moment of clarity," he was
        simply an ordinary, average man. In fact, writer Paddy Chayefsky
        specifically struck lengthy passages from Burton Wohl's official
        novelization of the film that describe the character's values and
        strengths. "In the right-hand margin, a perplexed Chayefsky wrote,
        'What's this shit got to do with anything?'"<sup title="Itzkoff (2014b), p.150"><a href="#itzkoff-2014b">4</a></sup>
        Howard represents the average person's outrage: he doesn't know what to
        do about the depression or the Russians or the crime on the street, he's
        just mad as hell. Despite his honesty and simplicity the dehumanizing
        power of television ruins him, eventually costing him his life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even those who already have strong beliefs and convictions are not
        immune, like hardcore communist leader Laureen Hobbs. At first she cares
        only about her political cause, going on about the struggle of the
        oppressed masses and criticizing the Ecumenical Liberation Army (based
        on the real-life
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbionese_Liberation_Army" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Symbionese
        Liberation Army</a><sup title="Trier (2006), p.234"><a href="#trier-2006">1</a></sup>)
        for being too radical. But all this changes when she becomes involved
        with UBS.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hobbs is tempted by the offer of being able to reach millions of
        Americans on a weekly basis in a drama series proposed by Diana
        Christensen. The next time we see her and the Ecumenicals they're
        pouring over paperwork with a bunch of lawyers, arguing about
        distribution charges and subsidiary rights. "In the end, it is they who
        agree to kill Howard Beale, the mad prophet, with whom they should have
        had so much in common."<sup title="Elliot (1977), p.75"><a href="#elliot-1977">2</a></sup>
        The scene is echoed in Arthur Jensen's monologue: "What do you think the
        Russians talk about in their councils of state? Karl Marx?" These
        idealists and radicals are just as susceptible to the allure of money
        and power as everyone else.

        If the institution of television can so effectively destroy and
        subjugate those who produce it, what hope do mere consumers have to
        resist? None, the film seems to say.
      </p>

      <p>
        Diana is contrasted against her much older lover Max. They come from
        different generations, and although she is also involved in the
        production of television her role in the film is to represent the
        generation raised by the tube. When confronted with the suffering and
        death of other human beings she sees only opportunities to gain power
        and money. Even while being intimate all she can talk about is work.
        "She is exploitative and unfeeling in a world already so insincere, and
        a walking embodiment of the worst qualities of the so-called 'television
        generation.'"<sup title="Alaska (2018)"><a href="#alaska-2018">5</a></sup>
      </p>

      <p>
        The film does not present much of a hope for the future. As Howard says
        to his audience, "You do whatever the tube tells you. You dress like the
        tube, you eat like the tube, you raise your children like the tube, you
        even think like the tube." Jensen might be right when he argues that the
        global system of systems&mdash;of television presenting packaged corporate
        propaganda as ultimate truth to the dehumanized masses&mdash;is eternal
        and unstoppable.
      </p>

      <h2 id="networks-legacy"><i>Network</i>'s legacy</h2>

      <p>
        Network opened to general critical acclaim, but some reviewers saw it as
        a "paranoid", "heavy-handed", or "wickedly distorted" version of
        reality.<sup title="Trier (2006), p.236"><a href="#trier-2006">1</a></sup>
        Perhaps they have a point. It certainly seems hypocritical to
        use the corrupt and commercialized medium of film to attack television
        for being corrupt and commercialized. To the filmmaker's credit, they go
        to great lengths to separate <i>Network</i> from the institution it
        criticizes.  Like many of Sidney Lumet's other films&mdash;and in
        contrast to all TV shows depicted in it&mdash;the film has no score,
        featuring only vÃ©ritÃ© sound.<sup title="Hubbert (2003), p.195"><a href="#hubbert-2003">6</a></sup>
        Likewise, writer Paddy Chayefsky saw the role of storyteller as simply
        "that of a man telling a story that might seem occasionally hard to
        believe but did in fact happen."<sup title="Itzkoff (2014b), p.149"><a href="#itzkoff-2014b">4</a></sup>
        The two men wanted merely to present a story in an honest and believable
        way.
      </p>

      <p>
        The powerful confrontation between Jensen and Beale in the conference
        room was originally intended to be filmed in the boardroom of the Wall
        Street headquarters of the New York Stock Exchange. In an
        unintentionally revealing move, the Exchange withdrew permission to use
        the room after reading the script for the scene.<sup title="Itzkoff (2014a), p.119"><a href="#itzkoff-2014a">3</a></sup>
        Perhaps they felt the scene hit a little too close to home, as Jensen
        argues in favor of enslavement to the "international system of
        currency." In any case, as the world grows smaller and mass media plays
        an increasingly important role in everyday life Lumet and Chayefsky's
        vision seems more real today than ever.

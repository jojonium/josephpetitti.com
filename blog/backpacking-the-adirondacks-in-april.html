      <h1 class="title">Backpacking the Adirondacks in April</h1>

      <p>
        Early Spring can mean a variety of conditions in the mountains, and I
        got to experience exactly that when I went on an overnight backpacking
        trip last weekend. In just 18 miles round-trip I summitted four
        4,000-footers and experienced steep scrambles, roaring waterfalls, deep
        snow, hot sun, and cold rain.
      </p>

      <div id="map-container"></div>

      <p>
        I started Friday morning at the Adirondack Mountain Reserve's hiker
        parking lot at St. Huberts. Despite their name, the AMR is a private
        club that owns a swath of land around Upper and Lower Ausable Lakes.
        The NY DEC has an easement with them to allow hikers to access the high
        peaks through the private property, but you have to abide by the AMR's
        rules and no camping or off-trail travel is allowed.
      </p>

      <p>
        The St. Huberts parking area provides access to many scenic locations
        through the AMR property, and apparently it gets so busy in the summer
        that reservations are required. When I arrived at 8:30 on Friday
        morning it was about one third full. I parked and started on the 1.5
        mile road walk to the start of the trail proper.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/lake-road.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_lake-road.jpg" alt="Lake Road, a dirt road through scenic Adirondack woods">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        This was a nice start, as road walks go. It was a sunny 50 degrees, and
        the dirt road winds past streams and boulders through some very scenic
        woods. I took the H.G. Leach Trail to the left and began the steady
        ascent to Bear Den Mountain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Around 2500 feet in elevation I passed the private property boundary
        onto public DEC land, the High Peaks Wilderness area. Pretty soon I
        started encountering patches of lingering snow and ice, but it was
        still hot and sunny out so I was sweating.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="../images/bear-den.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_bear-den.jpg" alt="New growth forest and deepening snow">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The summit of Bear Den Mountain apparently suffered a wildfire sometime
        in the recent past, judging from the remaining burn debris and dense
        new growth trees. As the snow became deeper and more consistent I put
        on my microspikes to keep from slipping.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some open ledges near the summit of Bear Den provided excellent views
        of the Great Range and approaching clouds. After a brief descent I
        continued climbing toward the first 4,000-footer of the trip, Dial
        Mountain.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/great-range-view.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_great-range-view.jpg" alt="View of the Great Range from ledges near Bear Den Mountain">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        I met a couple of other hikers coming down from Dial, who warned me the
        trail along the ridge from Dial to Nippletop was overgrown and
        difficult to follow, but at least I'd be able to stick to their
        footprints. I soon reached the outlook at the summit of Dial and
        stopped for a quick snack, then continued toward the higher Nippletop.
      </p>

      <p>
        The trail was indeed very overgrown and hard to follow, even with a set
        of footprints ahead of me. I was constantly pushing through spruce
        branches, stepping around fallen trees, and struggling to find trail
        markers. This made for very slow progress, but eventually I reached the
        intersection with Elk Pass Trail, which I would be taking down to the
        pass where I planned to camp. But first it was just .2 miles of sketchy
        up and down, edging along snow ledges to the summit of Nippletop, my
        13th Adirondack 4,000-footer.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/dix-view.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_dix-view.jpg" alt="View of the Dix Mountain from Nippletop">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        I was met by great views of the dramatic avalanche slides on Dix
        Mountain, as well as another view of Mount Marcy and the Great Range.
        It started lightly raining as I returned to the intersection, so I put
        on my rain pants and jacket to prepare for the steep descent to Elk
        Pass.
      </p>

      <p>
        This trail was extremely steep, even by Adirnodack standards,
        descending over 1,000 feet in just 0.6 miles. With the thick coating of
        ice and intensifying rain I ended up slipping and sliding down a lot of
        it.  Eventually I made it to the bottom, and found a designated
        campsite by a small pond.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was happy to have a freestanding tent, as it would have been
        difficult trying to anchor anything in the melting snow. Fortunately
        the rain had paused, so  I quickly set up camp, refilled my water
        bottles at the stream, and cooked some dinner.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/elk-pass-camp.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_elk-pass-camp.jpg" alt="Tent set up on the snow at Elk Pass">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        I crawled into my quilt as the sun was setting around 8:00 PM, just as
        it started raining again. I didn't end up getting much sleep. The sound
        of rain and wind kept waking me up, and my pillow had apparently
        developed a small hole because it would not stay inflated for more than
        a few minutes. I kept waking up with a sore neck every time there was a
        strong gust of wind. I definitely still prefer hammocks for camping, I
        always get a better sleep in them. My thermometer recorded an overnight
        low of 36 degrees, and I was happy to just get out of there when the
        sun finally rose in the morning.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was slightly delayed in packing up as I couldn't find where I had
        stashed my bear canister the night before, but I eventually retraced my
        steps and found it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I quickly made it to the intersection with Colvin Trail, which I would
        be taking for a 5 mile round trip out-and-back to bag two more
        4,000-footers. The trail starts with a relentless 800-foot climb up to
        the top Mount Colvin, where I got some nice views of the Ausable Lakes.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="../images/colvin.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_colvin.jpg" alt="View of Upper Ausable Lake from Mount Colvin">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        From the summit of Colvin, the next leg of the trip appeared pretty
        disheartening. I had to steeply descend roughly 500 feet to the col
        between Colvin and Blake Peak, then immediately climb 500 feet back up
        to Blake's summit. Then the only way back is to do the same thing again
        in reverse, all the way back up to Colvin. All for a peak without any
        views, which is only 3,960 feet high (Blake is included in the list
        because earlier surveys put it at the necessary 4,000 feet).
      </p>

      <p>
        I slowly and carefully climbed down from Colvin as it started raining
        harder. I had to lower myself down some rock ledges and over a couple
        of wooden ladders.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="../images/blake.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_blake.jpg" alt="Ladder on the descent from Colvin">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The bottom of the col was enveloped in fog and I almost got turned
        around and lost the trail a few times. The climb up Blake Peak was not
        as steep, but still grueling and with no view as a reward on the wooded
        summit. I ate a protein bar and turned around.
      </p>

      <p>
        The steep ascent back up to Colvin was rough, and I took it very slow.
        When I got back to the summit it was fully socked in by clouds and
        pouring rain. By the time I got back to the intersection with Elk Pass
        Trail it had been a full five hours for a 5 mile out-and-back.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was pretty exhausted, but I had accomplished my goal of bagging four
        more 4,000-foot peaks in the Adirondacks. I proceeded down Gill Brook
        Trail back towards the road, but decided at the last minute to take a
        small detour to Indian Head via the Fish Hawk Cliffs Trail.
      </p>

      <p>
        And I was glad I did, the cliffs overlooking Lower Ausable Lake had by
        far the best view of the whole trip.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="../images/indian-head.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_indian-head.jpg" alt="View of Lower Ausable Lake from Indian Head">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        I sat on the cliff for a long time despite the off-and-on rain, just
        taking in the view. Eventually I had to move on, climbing over the top
        of Indian Head and connecting back to Gill Brook Trail. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Indian Head was very picturesque, but Gill Brook was surprisingly
        scenic too. The water level was high from all the snow melt, and there
        were several spectacular waterfalls as the trail followed it back down
        to the road.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/artists-falls.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_artists-falls.jpg" alt="Artists Falls on Gill Brook">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Ice finally became sparse enough around 2,000 feet that I could take
        off my microspikes, and follow the gentle descent back to the road.
        This section was a great way to end the trip, and it was warm enough I
        didn't mind the light rain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gill Brook Trail eventually connected back to Lake Road, and I took the
        2.5 mile road walk back to the parking area, finishing right around
        6:00 PM on Saturday. Overall it was a great trip, spanning 18 miles and
        5,700 feet of elevation for four 4,000-footers and lots of unique views
        and different trail conditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Early Spring can be a difficult time for hiking, with unpredictable
        weather and variable conditions, but it can also lead to some
        incredible experiences if you're prepared.

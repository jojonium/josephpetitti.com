    <title>Lupin III: The First brings the franchise to 3D—and it works</title>
    <meta name="description" content="It's nice to see that Japan is getting better at 3D animation. For too long we've had to put up with horrible 3DCG posing as traditional animation by using ugly flat shading and animating on twos, like Graphinica's Expelled from Paradise or Polygon Pictures' Knights of Sidonia, Blame! and Godzilla films.  This style always ends up looking stiff and janky, and far worse than the 2D animation it's trying to immitate. But we can all rejoice now, because it seems that the era of terrible 3D anime is coming to an end. Lupin III: The First is the newest entry in the long-running Japanese franchise following gentleman thief Arsène Lupin III. This is the first entry to use 3D animation, and while it's not as technically impressive as your standard Disney/Pixar fare, it's fast, stylish, and damn good looking. It uses a unique art style that captures the iconic 2D character designs while using smooth animation and realistic lighting." />

        It's nice to see that Japan is getting better at 3D animation. For too
        long we've had to put up with horrible 3DCG posing as traditional
        animation by using ugly flat shading and animating on twos, like
        Graphinica's <i>Expelled from Paradise</i> or Polygon Pictures'
        <i>Knights of Sidonia</i>, <i>Blame!</i> and <i>Godzilla</i> films.

        This style always ends up looking stiff and janky, and far worse than
        the 2D animation it's trying to immitate. But we can all rejoice now,
        because it seems that the era of terrible 3D anime is coming to an end.

        <i>Lupin III: The First</i> is the newest entry in the long-running
        Japanese franchise following gentleman thief Arsène Lupin III. This is
        the first entry to use 3D animation, and while it's not as technically
        impressive as your standard Disney/Pixar fare, it's fast, stylish, and
        damn good looking. It uses a unique art style that captures the iconic
        2D character designs while using smooth animation and realistic
        lighting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of the textures and stuff like hair physics doesn't look great, but
        it's still a huge step up from Japan's previous attempts at 3DCG.
      </p>

      <p>
        The animation really shines in the action scenes, and these are the
        highlight of the film as well. They're full of over-the-top trickery and
        insane stunts, accentuated by the larger-than-life characters and Yuji
        Ohno's fantastic jazz score.
      <p>

      <p>
        The other aspects of the film are just average. The characters are fun,
        but the villains are kind of toothless. The story is a classic
        old-school archaeological adventure but a lot of points don't hold up if
        you think about them too much. And the fast pacing requires some awkward
        scene transitions to fit everything into 90 minutes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Still, it was a bunch of fun to watch, and gives me hope for the future
        of 3D anime.

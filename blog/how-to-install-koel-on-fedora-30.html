      <h1 class="title">How to install Koel on Fedora 30</h1>

      <p>
        <a href="https://koel.phanan.net/">Koel</a> is a cool web application
        built on PHP and Vue.js for streaming your music collection over the
        internet. Basically it's like having your own personal Spotify, except
        it's free and open source. Since I couldn't find any detailed guide for
        installing it and all its dependencies on a Fedora server, I decided to
        write my own.
      </p>

      <h2 id="install-laravel">Install Laravel</h2>

      <p>
        Koel depends on Laravel, a PHP web framework. Laravel in turn depends on
        PHP and composer.
      </p>

      <h3 id="install-a-dbms">Install a DBMS</h3>

      <p>
        If you already have a Datamase Management System server skip ahead to
        <a href="#install-php-and-composer">Install PHP</a>. If not, you'll have
        to install one either locally or on a separate server. Laravel is
        compatible with several DBMSs, but I like MariaDB (the community-driven
        fork of MySQL) so that's what I'll use.  Feel free to substitute
        PostreSQL, SQLite, or whatever else you prefer.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the database server run
      </p>

      <code class="block">$ sudo dnf install mariadb-server</code>

      <p>
        Now enable, start, and set up MariaDB by running:
      </p>
      
      <code class="block">$ sudo systemctl enable mariadb
$ sudo systemctl start mariadb
$ sudo mysql_secure_installation</code>

      <p>
        Just press enter the first time it prompts for the root password because
        it hasn't been set yet. Then set the root password to something strong,
        and answer each of the questions. The recommended answer to each of them
        is 'Y'.
      </p>

      <p>
        If MariaDB is running on a different server, the Koel server will still
        need to be able to access it. Install the <code>mysql</code> tool on the
        Koel server:
      </p>

      <code class="block">$ sudo dnf install mariadb</code>

      <h3 id="install-php-and-composer">Install PHP and Composer</h3>

      <p>
        Now we have to install PHP and all the extensions that Laravel depends
        on.
      </p>

      <code class="block">$ sudo dnf install php \
php-common \
php-cli \
php-pdo \
php-mbstring \
php-zip \
php-xml \
php-cli \
php-json \
php-mysqli</code>

      <p>
        Laravel uses Composer, a dependency manager for PHP. This can be
        installed with:
      </p>

      <code class="block">$ sudo dnf install composer</code>

      <p>
        Now we can use composer to install Laravel globally.
      </p>

      <code class="block">$ composer global require "laravel/installer"</code>

      <p>
        To make sure we can run the <code>laravel</code> command from anywhere,
        we need to add <code>~/.config/composer/vendor/bin</code> to our
        <code>PATH</code>. Add this line to the end of <code>~/.bashrc</code>:
      </p>

      <code class="block">export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin"</code>

      <p>
        Reload the config file with <code>$ source ~/.bashrc</code> and run this
        to test if it worked:
      </p>

      <code class="block">$ laravel --version</code>

      <p>
        You should get a nice message telling you the version of Laravel
        Installer you now have.
      </p>

      <h2 id="install-nodejs">Install Node.js</h2>

      <p>
        Koel also uses Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment, and Yarn, a
        JavaScript dependency manager. To install node on Fedora, just do
      </p>

      <code class="block">$ sudo dnf install nodejs</code>

      <p>
        Yarn isn't in the official Fedora repos, so you'll have to add theirs.
        See <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#centos-stable">here</a>
        for the most up-to-date instructions for that. Then just run:
      </p>

      <code class="block">$ sudo dnf install yarn</code>

      <p>
        One of the JavaScript packages that Koel depends on requires
        <code>libpng</code> development tools, so install them with
      </p>

      <code class="block">$ sudo dnf install libpng-devel</code>

      <p>
        Now we're finally done with dependencies and can move on to install
        Koel itself!
      </p>

      <h2 id="install-koel">Install Koel</h2>

      <p>
        Let's make a directory for the Koel installation (replace
        <code>USER</code> with your own username)
      </p>

      <code class="block">$ sudo mkdir /var/www/koel
$ sudo chown -R USER:USER /var/www/koel</code>

      <p>
        Now clone the repo into that directory (<code># dnf install git</code>
        if you don't already have it).
      </p>

      <code class="block">$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/phanan/koel.git /var/www/koel</code>

      <p>
        We want to checkout the most recent stable version, so check
        <a href="https://github.com/phanan/koel/releases">the releases page</a>
        to find out what that is. As of time of writing it's
        <code>v4.2.2</code>.
      </p>

      <code class="block">$ cd /var/www/koel
$ git checkout v4.2.2</code>

      <p>
        Use composer to install all PHP dependencies
      </p>

      <code class="block">$ composer install</code>

      <p>
        We're almost set, now we just have to set up a database user for Koel.
      </p>

      <h3 id="prepare-the-database">Prepare the database</h3>

      <p>
        These instructions are for MariaDB/MySQL, but other DBMSs should be
        similar. From the database server, which may be the same as the one
        you're installing Koel on, log into MySQL as root.
      </p>

      <code class="block">$ mysql -u root -p</code>

      <p>
        Enter the MySQL root password when prompted.
      </p>

      <p>
        If Koel is running on a different machine from your database, edit
        <code>/etc/my.cnf</code>. Add a <code>[mysqld]</code> section if it
        doesn't already exist, then add <code>bind-address=0.0.0.0</code> below
        it. If there's a line containing <code>skip-networking</code> comment it
        out or delete it. This makes MariaDB listen to all IPv4 addresses rather
        than just localhost. Then <code>$ sudo systemctl restart mariadb</code>
        to reload the config.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now we're going to create a database called <code>koel</code> and a user
        called <code>koel-db-user</code> with permissions for that database.
        Replace <code>koel-pass</code> with a strong password for the user. If
        Koel is running on a different host from the database replace
        <code>localhost</code> with the hostname or IP address of the Koel
        server below.
      </p>

      <code class="block">mysql&gt; CREATE DATABASE koel DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
mysql&gt; CREATE USER 'koel-db-user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'koel-pass';
mysql&gt; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON koel.* TO 'koel-db-user'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
mysql&gt; exit;</code>

      <p>
        Now return to the Koel server.
      </p>

      <h3 id="final-setup">Final setup</h3>

      <p>
        Back on the Koel server, running this command will allow you to populate
        the <code>.env</code> file with your credentials, as well as pull in
        frontend dependencies with yarn. Make sure you're still in
        <code>/var/www/koel</code>, then do:
      </p>

      <code class="block">$ php artisan koel:init</code>

      <p>
        Answer each of the prompted questions, including the database
        credentials you set up <a href="prepare-the-database">above</a>. Now
        you're done! If you run <code>$ php artisan serve</code> you should be
        able to visit the web interface at <code>http://localhost:8000</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is just the development server, but the production server can be
        set up the same way as any other PHP application. I used Nginx with a
        config file based on the
        <a href="https://github.com/phanan/koel/blob/master/nginx.conf.example">sample
        Nginx config</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

      <p>
        Here's some advice to get through some of the issues I encountered.
      </p>

      <p>
        First I faced an issue where Koel didn't have permission to write to the
        <code>storage</code> directory. Edit
        <code>/etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf</code> to see what user and group it's
        running as. I was using Nginx, so I set them both like so
      </p>

      <code class="block">user = nginx
group = nginx</code>

      <p>
        Restart the php-fpm daemon to apply the change and set the Koel
        directory to be owned by that user and group.
      </p>

      <code class="block">$ sudo systemctl restart php-fpm
$ sudo chown -R nginx:nginx /var/www/koel</code>

      <p>
        That should have fixed the issue, but for me it didn't. If you're on
        a Red Hat system and you've been banging your head against the wall for
        an hour trying to figure out why something that should work doesn't
        work, 99% of the time the issue is
        <a href="https://selinuxproject.org/page/Main_Page">SELinux</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        It turns out you need to explicitly give Nginx write permission for that
        directory in SELinux. You can use a tool called <code>semanage</code> to
        make this easier.
      </p>

      <code class="block">$ sudo dnf install policycoreutils-python-utils
$ sudo semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t "/var/www/koel/storage(/.*)?"
$ sudo restorecon -R /var/www/koel/storage</code>

      <p>
        Credit to <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/116575/selinux-httpd-write-access-to-a-directory">this StackExchange post</a>
        for that solution.
      </p>

      <p>
        That managed to solve that permission issue, but I was still getting
        another. I had logs claiming permission was denied to access the
        database even though I made sure the host, port, username, database
        name, and password were correct. It turns out that SELinux was getting
        in the way here too. You need to explicitly allow Nginx to connect to
        databases over the network, which can be done with this command:
      </p>

      <code class="block">$ sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_db=1</code>

      <p>
        Credit to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42937925/laravel-permission-denied-on-remote-mysql-server-aws-aurora">this StackOverflow post</a>
        for that solution.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your music collection is on a shared network drive, like mine, you'll
        need to explicitly allow Nginx to read from it too. Do one of the
        following, depending on the type of network drive you have:
      </p>

      <code class="block">$ sudo setsebool -P httpd_use_cifs on
$ sudo setsebool -P httpd_use_nfs on</code>

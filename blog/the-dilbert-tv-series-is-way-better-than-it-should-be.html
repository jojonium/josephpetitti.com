      <h1 class="title">The <i>Dilbert</i> TV series is way better than it should be</h1>

      <p>
        Everyone's read <i>Dilbert</i> in the daily newspaper or seen it taped
        to a boss or professor's door, but few know about the animated
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilbert_(TV_series)">TV series</a>
        based on it that ran for 30 episodes in 1999-2000. I had the good
        fortune of stumbling across this cartoon recently, and it turned out to
        be way better than I expected, given the lack of acclaim I hear for it.

        Like the comic, the TV show focuses on the life of cubicle dweller
        Dilbert, and his generally lazy and incompetent coworkers. The comic
        concerns situations almost anyone who has held a white collar office job
        has dealt with, and is a great source of relatable corporate humor.
      </p>

      <p>
        Usually when a family-friendly medium like a daily comic strip makes the
        jump to adult-oriented television the result is less than enjoyable.
        <i>Dilbert</i> creator Scott Adams (who is also a
        <a href="https://www.scottadamssays.com/coffee-with-scott-adams-podcast/">trained hypnotist</a>
        and possibly insane) worked directly on the show, writing and producing
        several of the episodes.
      </p>

        <p class="quote">It's a very freeing experience because doing the comic
        strip limits me to three (picture) panels with four lines or less of
        dialogue per issue, in the TV series, I have 21 minutes per episode to
        be funny.</p>

        The result is an adult animated series that's actually really funny. The
        cast of characters are fun and have great chemistry together. The longer
        runtime of a TV show gives them more time to be fleshed out as
        characters. The voice acting is also pretty good, including the talents
        of Tom Kenny and Larry Miller.

        It's goofy at times, but the humor really holds up, even 20 years later.
        It's even better if you've had a cubicle-centric engineering job, or an
        unbelievably dense boss. It's the ordinary everyday frustration
        stretched to absurdity that's so good.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's also straight up weird at times. Like those early <i>Spongebob</i>
        episodes, it has those moments where it gets truly bizarre, like the
        episode where the office is terrorized by miniaturized past employees
        (who had been "downsized") and are now addicted to sniffing whiteboard
        markers.
      </p>

      <p>
        The animation's about on par with other animated shows from this era,
        but it still looks great compared to sterile computer-generated garbage
        like <i>Family Guy</i> and <i>American Dad</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        It even has a bop of an opening theme, composed by Danny Elfman, for
        which it won a Primetime Emmy:

      <p>
        It's just a shame that it was cancelled after only two seasons, mainly
        because of mistakes the network made. In another timeline,
        <i>Dilbert</i> ended up becoming the next <i>Simpsons</i>. Although,
        maybe it's better that it ended while it was still good.

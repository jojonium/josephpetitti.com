      <h1 class="title">My top 10 favorite research papers</h1>

      <p>
        Here are some of the most amusing or intriguing studies, reports, and
        papers I've stumbled across:
      </p>

      <ol reversed>
        <li>
          A 2010 study titled "Are cows more likely to lie down the longer they
          stand?" It found that the longer a cow has been lying down the more
          likely it is that cow will stand up soon, but that the probability of
          a standing cow lying down does not increase over time (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168159110000547?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tolkamp et al., 2010</a>).
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          From the journal Animal Conservation, "A novel non-invasive tool for
          disease surveillance of free-ranging whales and its relevance to
          conservation programs" (<a
            href="https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-1795.2009.00326.x">Acevedo-Whitehouse,
            Rocha-Gosselin, & Gendron, 2010</a>). In other words, collecting
          whale snot with a remote-controlled helicopter.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          A Government Accountability Office report titled "Actions Needed to
          Evaluate the Impact of Efforts to Estimate Costs of Reports and
          Studies"&mdash;a 32-page report about reports about reports that
          recommends the preparation of a report about the report about reports
          about reports (<a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-12-480R" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GAO,
          2012</a>).
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          The groundbreaking and important study "No evidence of contagious
          yawning in the red-footed tortoise <i>Geochelone carbonaria</i>" 
          (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/cz/article/57/4/477/1812036" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Huber
            et al., 2011</a>). Where would we be without this cutting edge
          research?
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          "An analysis of the forces required to drag sheep over various
          surfaces" (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687002000716?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harvey
            et al., 202</a>). This one really speaks for itself.
        </li>

        </figure>

        <br>
        <li>
          The medical research study "Why Do Old Men Have Big Ears?" (<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/311/7021/1668" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heathcote, 1995</a>).
          Asking the real questions.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          A research study "On the reception and detection of pseudo-profound
          bullshit," a skill I wish I had (<a href="http://journal.sjdm.org/15/15923a/jdm15923a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cheyne et al., 2015</a>)
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          A real paper published in the Journal of Analytical Psychology titled
          "Farting as a defence against unspeakable dread" (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1465-5922.1996.00165.x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sidoli, 1996</a>).
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          The terrifying report from the Annals of Emergency Medicine,
          "Termination of Intractable Hiccups with Digital Rectal Massage" (<a href="https://www.annemergmed.com/article/S0196-0644(88)80594-8/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fesmire, 1988</a>).
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          A federally-funded project at Southern Illinois University spent
          $121,000 and two years studying the effect of marijuana on sexual
          arousal by "exposing groups of male pot-smokers to pornographic
          films" (Sadly I couldn't find the actual 1976 paper from this study,
          it may be lost to time. Here's a <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/192/4238/450" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">citation</a>
          confirming its existence at least).

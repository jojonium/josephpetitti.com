      <h1 class="title">Making a 2D game with no art assets</h1>

      <p>
        In my <a href="designing-an-extensible-power-up-system">last blog
        post</a> I wrote about the game I'm working on with two of my friends.
        It now officially has a name, 
        <a href="https://afterlightcaves.com">Afterlight Caves</a>, and we're
        going to be showing it off at the WPI booth at
        <a href="https://east.paxsite.com/">PAX East</a>, February 27 through
        March 1 2020. In this post I'll talk about how three computer science
        majors with no artistic ability between them were able to make a decent
        looking game.
      </p>

        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The game's graphics system is powered by the 
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">JavaScript Canvas API</a>,
        which allows you to draw simple lines, circles, and rectangles onto an
        HTML canvas. Though simple, this API is deceptively powerful, and
        combining its various features allowed us to make some cool-looking
        effects.
      </p>

      <figure class="float left">
        <img src="images/afterlight-caves-enemy.gif">
      </figure>

      <p>
        By combining these simple concepts we were able to make a surprisingly
        complex game world without any images, sprites, or textures. Every
        visual element is generated programmatically using only pure JavaScript.
      </p>

      <h2 id="simple-particles">Simple particles</h2>

      <p>
        Good looking particles add a lot of excitement and motion to a game, and
        they can be surprisingly simple to make. In our physics system, all
        entities have velocity, acceleration, and drag. Using these, we can
        create simple line-based particles very easily.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/afterlight-caves-2.png">
          <img src="images/th_afterlight-caves-2.png" alt="Screenshot of Afterlight Caves">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Each particle has a lifetime, after which it is automatically removed
        from the world, an initially high velocity, and high drag. It's drawn as
        a line with length as a function of its velocity, so it naturally
        shortens as it slows down until it is removed. This creates a nice
        spark-like effect that is computationally cheap and snappy.
      </p>

      <h2 id="glow-effect">Glow effect</h2>

      <p>
        <a href="https://www.bandaloo.fun">Cole</a> came up with a cool way to
        give Afterlight Caves a glowing, neon look. The display manager
        maintains a separate canvas, called the <code>blurCanvas</code> that's
        half the dimensions of the main display canvas (so it's only a quarter
        of the pixels). The <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/filter">filter</a></code> attribute of this canvas' is set to a string of filter functions:
      </p>

      <code class="block">const blurContext = blurCanvas.getContext("2d");
blurContext.filter = "blur(3px) brightness(200%)";</code>

      <p>
        Each frame, the game world and all entities and particles are drawn onto
        the <code>canvas</code>. Then, the <code>canvas</code> is scaled to half
        its original dimensions and drawn onto the <code>blurCanvas</code>. The
        lower resolution and filter string create the bright, glowing effect we
        want.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then, the <code>blurCanvas</code> is drawn onto the
        <code>displayCanvas</code>, the one that's actually visible to the user.
        Next, all UI elements (menus, health bars, etc.) are drawn onto the
        <code>canvas</code>. This prevents text elements from getting blurred.
        Finally, the <code>canvas</code> is drawn onto the
        <code>displayCanvas</code>, which has its <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/globalCompositeOperation">globalCompositeOperation</a></code>
        set to "lighter," placing the regular game world and UI elements on top
        of the glowing game world.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <h2 id="splatter-effect">Splatter effect</h2>

      <p>
        When enemies die, they create a nice splatter effect on the floor that
        permanently sticks around in the game world. This provides satisfying
        visual feedback for each enemy killed, and leaves a way to tell which
        areas of the world you've been to before.
      </p>

      <p>
        These splatters are also generated programmatically, using a separate
        canvas. The <code>splatterCanvas</code> has dimensions equal to one
        fourth of the display canvas, so it only has one sixteenth of the
        pixels. When an enemy dies, it draws several random rectangles at its
        location on the splatter canvas.
      </p>

      <p>
        These rectangles are distributed according to the enemy's velocity
        before it died. If a shot (or bomb) deals more damage than the enemy has
        health, the extra damage is converted into velocity, creating a nice
        splatter effect.
      </p>

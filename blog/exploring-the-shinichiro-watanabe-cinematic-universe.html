        Exploring the Shinichirō Watanabe Cinematic Universe
      </h1>

      <p>
        Director Shinichirō Watanabe is well known for his science fiction and
        fantasy anime worlds filled with memorable characters, creative
        technology, and wonderous adventures. It appears that three of his
        critically acclaimed series, <i>Cowboy Bebop</i>, <i>Space Dandy</i>,
        and <i>Carole &amp; Tuesday</i> take place in the same universe, but the
        truth is much more complicated than that.
      </p>

        <i>Space Dandy</i> exists in the <i>Cowboy Bebop</i> universe
      </h2>

      <p>
        Although the two shows are very different in tone and setting, there is
        abundant evidence that <i>Space Dandy</i> takes place in the same universe
        as <i>Cowboy Bebop</i>, although likely at a much later point in time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both series use the Woolong as their currency. This fictional, often
        digital currency is approximately equal in value to the Japanese Yen.

      <p>
        But even more interesting is the <i>Bebop</i>'s fridge. In episode 11, a
        Ganymede rock lobster left in the fridge for over a year mutates into a
        monster and attacks the crew. In the end, Spike pushes the fridge out of
        the airlock and it isn't seen again.

      <p>
        That is, until 16 years later when <i>Space Dandy</i> aired. In episode
        8, the crew of the <i>Aloha Oe</i> travels to Planet Machinia, a scrap
        planet filled with old spaceship parts.  Almost immediately upon landing
        Meow discovers an old fridge, and opens it looking for food.
      </p>

        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Upon opening it he is immediately attacked by the same blob monster that
        terrorized the <i>Bebop</i>'s crew so many years ago. This evidence can
        lead us to conclude that <i>Space Dandy</i> takes place in the same
        universe as <i>Cowboy Bebop</i>, although at a much later date. The
        greatly advanced technology, presence of aliens, and existence of human
        colonies throughout the galaxy mean that <i>Space Dandy</i> must take
        place dozens, if not hundreds, of years after its predecessor.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seems simple enough. These two series can fit into each other's
        universes pretty easily, without creating any continuity issues or plot
        holes. However, Watanabe's newest series, <i>Carole &amp; Tuesday</i>,
        complicates things a bit.
      </p>

      <h2 id="how-does-carole-and-tuesday-fit-in">
        How does <i>Carole &amp; Tuesday</i> fit in?
      </h2>

      <p>
        <i>Carole &amp; Tuesday</i> is pretty different from the other shows
        I've talked about so far. For one thing, it's barely science fiction. It
        takes place on Mars, and AI is commonplace, but the story itself could
        take place in almost any time period and location. Instead of being
        about a small crew of eccentric heroes travelling through space and
        struggling to make a living, it's about two young girls attempting to
        hit it big as musicians.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite this change in basic plot structure, there is abundant evidence
        that <i>Carole &amp; Tuesday</i> also takes place in <i>Cowboy
        Bebop</i>'s universe. Woolongs are also the currency here (although
        their value seems to be different):
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/carole-and-tuesday-woolong.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_carole-and-tuesday-woolong.jpg" alt="Woolongs in Carole and Tuesday">
        </a>
        <figcaption>Episode 3 of <i>Carole &amp; Tuesday</i></figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        And most of the action takes place in 
        <a href="https://cowboybebop.fandom.com/wiki/Alba_City">Alba City</a>,
        the same Martian city from <i>Cowboy Bebop: The Movie</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        But here's where it starts to get complicated. When exactly does 
        <i>Carole &amp; Tuesday</i> take place? In episode 3, Gus says it's been
        almost "50 years since humanity's migration to Mars." In <i>Cowboy
        Bebop</i>'s timeline, the 
        <a href="https://cowboybebop.fandom.com/wiki/Astral_Gate_accident">Lunar
        hyperspace gate</a> exploded in 2021, causing Earth's residents to move
        underground or flee for the offworld colonies throughout the solar
        system.  If we assume this is what Gus was talking about, that would
        place <i>Carole &amp; Tuesday</i> at approximately 2071, around the same
        time that the events of <i>Cowboy Bebop</i> take place.
      </p>

      <p>
        But this leads to some continuity errors. The technology in <i>Carole
        &amp; Tuesday</i> is more advanced than in <i>Cowboy Bebop</i>,
        including smartphones and cheap multi-purpose robots.
      </p>

      <p>
        To make things even more confusing, the most recent episode included
        this:
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/carole-and-tuesday-1.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_carole-and-tuesday-1.jpg" alt="Space Dandy in Carole & Tuesday">
        </a>
        <figcaption>
          A robot in <i>Carole &amp; Tuesday</i> watching <i>Space Dandy</i> on
          a smartphone
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Is <i>Space Dandy</i> just a fictional show in the <i>Carole &amp;
        Tuesday</i> universe? This raises all kinds of questions. How could the
        creators of this show have known about the fridge from <i>Cowboy
        Bebop</i>?
      </p>

      <h2 id="my-theory">My Theory</h2>

      <p>
        The only way that all of these series can fit together in one universe
        is if both <i>Cowboy Bebop</i> and <i>Space Dandy</i> are works of
        fiction within the world of <i>Carole &amp; Tuesday</i>. This would
        resolve the discrepancies between technology levels, as <i>Cowboy
        Bebop</i> could be an alternate history version of present-day (2071)
        Mars. It would also explain the fridge in <i>Space Dandy</i>, as just a
        reference to another show. Finally, it would explain why all three have
        the same currency.
      </p>

      <p>
        I realize that retconning two great shows into mere works of fiction in
        another show's universe is supremely unsatisfying, but I can't think of
        any other way that all this evidence can fit together. On the other
        hand, as of writing this post there are still eight more episodes of
        <i>Carole &amp; Tuesday</i> that are yet to air, so we could get new
        information in the future.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alternatively, you could just not think about it as much as I have and
        just enjoy these shows for what they are. If you think I've missed
        something or you have a better theory, I'd be interested to hear about
        it. Drop me an <a href="mailto:jppetitti@wpi.edu">email</a> and let me
        know.

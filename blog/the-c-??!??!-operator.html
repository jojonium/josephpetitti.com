      <h1 class="title">The C ??!??! operator</h1>

      <p>
        The C programming language has a bit of a reputation for having weird
        syntax. The <code>#define</code> directive, pointer declaration, and
        uncommon array indexing methods can all make it hard to understand
        what's going on in a C program. Still, some of C's weirdness manages to
        surprise me even after using it for a few years. For example, what do
        you think this expression does?
      </p>

      <code class="block">!x ??!??! y();</code>

      <p>
        If you guessed that it's a basic <code>if</code> statement, you'd be
        correct. The above line is equivalent to this:
      </p>

      <code class="block">if (x) {
    y();
}</code>

      <p>
        The first step to understanding this is to realize that
        <code>??!??!</code> isn't really an operator at all, it's actually two
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraphs_and_trigraphs#C">trigraphs</a>
        in a row. This is an old feature of the C preprocessor that replaces
        a sets of three characters with their equivalent before compiling.
      </p>

      <figure class="float right">
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Trigraph</th>
            <th>Equivalent</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>??=</code></td>
            <td><code>#</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>??/</code></td>
            <td><code>\</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>??'</code></td>
            <td><code>^</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>??(</code></td>
            <td><code>[</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>??)</code></td>
            <td><code>[</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>??!</code></td>
            <td><code>|</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>??&lt;</code></td>
            <td><code>{</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>??&gt;</code></td>
            <td><code>}</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>??-</code></td>
            <td><code>~</code></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </figure>

      <p>
        These were apparently included so that programmers who didn't have
        certain keys on their keyboard could still use all the features of C.
      </p>

      <p>
        We can see that the <code>??!</code> gets replaced by the pipe
        character, so <code>??!??!</code> is actually <code>||</code> the
        logical OR operator.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thanks to the power of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation">short-circuit evaluation</a>,
        <code>y()</code> is only executed if the first statement,
        <code>!x</code> is false. 
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not a good way of writing an <code>if</code> statement, and I
        would never recommend using this in practice, but it's interesting to
        see how rules of C can lead to such weird-looking code being perfectly
        valid.
      </p>

      <p>
        As another weird C thing, here's a perfectly valid way to access an
        element of an array:
      </p>

      <code class="block">NULL[array + 10];</code>

      <p>
        Due to the nature of memory addressing, this is the same as writing:
      </p>

      <code class="block">array[10];</code>

      <p>
        To make it even cooler, try:
      </p>

      <code class="block">0??(array + 10??);</code>
    </main>

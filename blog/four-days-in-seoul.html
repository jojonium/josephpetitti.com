      <h1 class="title">Four Days in Seoul</h1>

      <p>
        After an exhausting 44-hour journey involving planes, trains, and
        automobiles, I arrived in Seoul, South Korea this past Sunday. I'll be
        spending the next three months in Kyoto, Japan working on my Major
        Qualifying Project for WPI, but before that I wanted to spend some time
        seeing another city I had never been to before.
      </p>

      <p>
        After finishing the last day of my internship on Friday, I took a train
        into Boston. My roommate Cole, who will also be involved in my MQP, and
        I caught plane to Seoul the next morning. Between the length of the
        flight and the time zone difference we landed a full 30 hours after we
        departed.

      <p>
        Aside from the oppresive heat and humidity, and the permanently overcast
        sky, Seoul is a beautiful city. Modern skyscrapers stand right next to
        ancient temples and palaces, and the streets are lined with everything
        from traditional street food stalls to VR arcades.
      </p>

        Monday: exploring the Yongsan electronics market
      </h2>

      <p>
        We were too tired from travelling and jet lag to do anything major on
        Sunday, but when Monday morning rolled around we decided to wander
        around and see what could be found near our apartment. We were a bit
        nervous about using the Seoul metro after a travel YouTuber had decried
        it as confusing and scary, but the reality was pleasantly surprising.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">

        <figcaption>
          The spaghetti maze of subway lines appears daunting at first, but is
          actually quite straightforward
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Trains in Seoul are incredibly clean and quiet. There are a lot of
        subway lines and stations, but it's easy to get around because the
        signage is clear, and everything is labelled in Korean, English,
        Japanese, and Chinese.
      </p>

      <p>
        The subway is also super cheap. Travelling to almost anywhere in the
        city was only about $1.25, and even the train to the airport was just
        three bucks.
      </p>

      <p>
        With our newfound mastery of the subway system, Cole and I ventured to
        Yongsan to see one of the biggest electronics markets in the country.
        This section of the city contains thousands of tiny stores selling any
        kind of electronics you can imagine. Processors, graphics cards, full
        laptops, plugs, cables, and adapters of every kind, even expensive video
        equipment.
      </p>

        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        This place was massive, and a lot of the goods were cheaper than you
        could find on Amazon in the US. It was well worth the trip, I just wish
        I actually needed some electronics so I'd have an excuse to buy
        something.
      </p>

      <h2 id="the-han-river-and-hongdae">Tuesday: the Han River and Hongdae</h2>

      <p>
        On Tuesday we took a trip to see some parks around the scenic Han River.
        Just walking around and relaxing for most of the day was nice, but in
        the evening we decided to check out Hongdae, a trendy area near Hongik
        University.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/han-river-bridge.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_han-river-bridge.jpg" alt="A bridge over the Han River">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Hongdae was packed full of cool stuff to see and do, with lots of street
        performances and restaurants. There were also a lot more tourists than
        we had seen previously.
      </p>

        <figcaption>A <i>One Piece</i>-themed cafe in Hongdae</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        We also ran into a bubble tea place called Tiger Sugar, which I
        recognized from my time in Hong Kong. I've never seen the place not be
        packed, but it's worth the wait because their bubble tea is incredible.
      </p>

        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        But the best part of Hongdae is the night life. The dozens of
        restaurants, shops, and arcades are a lot of fun to explore. We even got
        to experience a "VR theme park," which was a little underwhelming but
        still a unique experience. 
      </p>

      <h2 id="wednesday-dongdeamun-design-plaza">
        Wednesday: Dongdaemun Design Plaza
      </h2>

      <p>
        Our hotel was in an area called Dongdaemun, right next to this really
        cool-looking park/plaza/building thing. The whole time we were in Seoul
        we had been meaning to check it out, and on Wednesday we finally did. It
        turned out to be a design museum called the Dongdaemun Design Plaza.
      </p>

        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The whole plaza has some really neat architecture, and was interesting
        just to walk around and look at. There were lots of open spaces where
        you could sit and relax, and if I lived in the area full time I could
        see myself going there a lot to do work.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p>
        Inside there was an exhibit on British designed Paul Smith, which was
        pretty interesting to see. I only knew about him in a general sense
        beforehand but Cole was a big fan.
      </p>

        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        There was also an exhibit on the design of chairs, which was way more
        interesting than it sounds. I never realized there could be so much 
        variation in such a simple product. This exhibit included pieces by
        well-known designers from all over the world, as well as some
        less-famous entries.

      <p>
        The DDP took up most of the day, but in the evening we checked out some
        other arcades in the area and had some Korean fried chicken, which was
        delicious. At a VR arcade in Dongdaemon I got a chance to play some Beat
        Saber, which is always fun.

        Thursday: Bongeunsa Temple and traditional food
      </h2>

      <p>
        For our last day in Seoul we planned two big excursions. In the morning
        we went to see Bongeunsa Temple, an ancient Buddhist temple in the heart
        of Seoul, and in the evening we booked a "food tour" to try some
        traditional Korean cuisine we might have missed out on otherwise.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bongeunsa Temple, despite being right next to a subway station and
        shopping mall, was still being used in the same way it had been for the
        past 1200 years. When we arrived in the morning there was a Buddhist
        ceremony currently in progress, and the huge crowd of people chanting
        was a sight to behold. The temple is brilliantly preserved, and new
        buildings are currently under construction.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">

          The entire temple complex was filled with thousands of these lanterns

          temple">

      </figure>

      <p>
        All of this was right in the middle of Gangnam district in central
        Seoul. In fact, as we were leaving the temple we ran into a huge
        monument to Gangnam's most famous product:
      </p>

        <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        For our last excursion of the trip we decided to go on a food tour.
        We went with a Korean tour guide and a Swiss man who was (of course) a
        watchmaker and his family to three different restaurants to try the best
        local dishes.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the first restaurant we had Korean barbecue, basically pork belly,
        kimchi, and bean sprouts that you cook yourself at the table and wrap in
        a lettuce leaf to eat. I had had Korean barbecue once before in Hong
        Kong, but it was still my favorite meal of the entire trip. Nothing
        beats good meat.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the barbecue we went to a cafe to have a soup-like dish called
        tteok-bokki. It consisted of stir-fried rice cakes, noodles, fish, and
        various vegetables, along with a side of pickled raddish. I thought it
        was delicious, and would definitely try it again. Interestingly, the
        cafe we were at had two cats that roamed around the dining area and no
        one seemed to care.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, to finish off the evening we travelled to a tiny
        hole-in-the-wall restaurant for Korean pancakes. These aren't pancakes
        in the traditional sense, they're actually vegetables or kimchi coated
        in flour and egg and pan-fried. They were a good snack, and a great way
        to finish out the day.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">

      </figure>

      <p>
        It was a great trip as a whole. Seoul is an amazing city, and in the
        four days I was there I barely scratched the surface of all there is to
        do in it. I'd love to go back some day, maybe with a little more
        knowledge of Korean and some more time to spend in the country.
      </p>

      <p>
        For now I'm off to Kyoto, Japan to work on my senior project for the
        next three months.

      <h1 class="title">Meet the Cloud Office: the workplace of the future</h1>

      <p>
        Nobody wants to deal with the hassle of maintaining hardware. It's
        expensive, difficult, and time consuming to set up your own networked
        infrastructure, and many companies just aren't dealing with it any more.
        But as more and more of our computer systems are transitioned into "the
        cloud," we could end up in a world where the office as we know it is
        obsolete.

        Server rooms are slowly becoming extinct in many small companies. Why
        bother paying for server racks, space to keep them, air conditioning to 
        keep them cool, system administrators to maintain them, and upgrades
        every few years when you can just offload all that responsibility to
        someone else. Even web-focused companies rarely have their own servers
        on premises.
      </p>

      <p>
        AWS is so simple you can spin up an EC2 instance with an S3 bucket for
        hosting your website front end, an API gateway for your app's REST API,
        an RDS instance for your database, and a Glacier instance for your
        long-term cold storage in just a few hours. It offloads your
        responsibilities onto someone else and saves money, what's not to like?
      </p>

      <p>
        But more than just web services are moving to the cloud. Why manage your
        own network attached storage on your own expensive, breakable disks? Why
        manage your own internal email server when you can pay Google or
        Microsoft to do it for you?
      </p>

      <p>
        Big tech companies are trying to take advantage of this trend. Google's
        Chromebooks have miniscule storage and processing power, and rely on
        Google's Internet architecture to be usable as full computers. Microsoft
        seems to be trying to go in the 
        <a href="https://fossbytes.com/windows-10-cloud-iso-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">same 
        direction</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        It makes sense from Big Tech's perspective: more services going through
        their networks means more data to collect and more control over peoples'
        lives. Google has aggressively promoted the use of Chromebooks by
        elementary schools by offering them free services like 
        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/13/technology/google-education-chromebooks-schools.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google 
        Classroom</a>. The real goal is to lock children into the Google
        ecosystem from an early age, and create a generation that grows up not
        understanding the concept of a 
        <a href="https://youtu.be/llZys3xg6sU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personal computer</a>.

      <p>
        Assuming this trend towards the cloud continues, what will the future of
        workplaces look like? Well, the final piece of infrastructure to move
        offsite for many companies is their own employees' personal desktops and
        laptops, and the networking equipment that they require. This is already
        possible today, with virtual private servers running in the cloud and
        thin clients to connect to them. But that still leaves a need for
        routers, switches, and ethernet cables.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next logical step is to remove the computer users as well. Why
        bother coming into the office when everything is in the cloud? You can
        just remotely log in to your "workstation" from home.
      </p>

      <p>
        If everyone works at home, why even have an office? Good idea, taking
        care of property is expensive, get rid of it. We'll communicate by email
        and Slack, keep our files in a VPS, and and hold conference by phone. We
        can even hire new people by Skype.
      </p>

      <p>
        And that's it, the death of the office as we know it. The Cloud Office
        is really no office at all. No more water coolers, and no more water
        cooler conversations to distract people from working. In fact, you might
        never even meet your coworkers face to face.  Maybe they're not even
        real people. Is it too far-fetched to imagine finding out that your boss
        is really just a simple script that sends passive-aggressive emails
        whenever you miss a deadline?

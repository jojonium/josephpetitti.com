      <h1 class="title">How to climb Mount Fuji</h1>

      <p>
        Last week, after spending a day at <a href="fuji-q-highland-proof-that-you-can-make-a-theme-park-out-of-anything">Fuji-Q
        Highland</a>, I set out with a group of three other students to climb
        to the highest point in Japan, the summit of Mount Fuji.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Fujisan</i> (富士山) is a 3,776 meter tall active stratovolcano
        within sight of Tokyo on a clear day. Its cone is remarkably
        symmetrical, and it stands alone in a mostly flat plain away from other
        mountain ranges. For these reasons, it has been a subject of Japanese
        art for hundreds of years.

      <h2 id="day-1-climb-to-8th-station">Day 1: Climb to 8th Station</h2>

      <p>
        There are two main routes up the mountain, the Yoshida and Subashiri
        trails. Both are only open for two months out of the year, from early
        July to early September. Because of this, the mountain tends to be very
        crowded with Japanese climbers and foreign visitors. To avoid these
        crowds, we decided to climb at the end of climbing season (actually the
        last days possible, September 9 and 10), and take the slightly longer
        and steeper trail, Subashiri.
      </p>

      <p>
        Luck also seemed to be on our side, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Pacific_typhoon_season#Typhoon_Faxai">Typhoon Faxai</a>,
        the strongest storm to hit Japan in 60 years, blew through the area the
        night of September 8. While it made our time at Fuji-Q a little wet, it
        had already passed by the time we started climbing on the 9th. The storm
        apparently scared away other hikers, because we practically had the
        mountain to ourselves the first day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although the official trailhead is much lower, you can take a bus to
        Subashiri Trail 5th Station at 2,000 meters. This is what we chose to
        do, and I'd recommend it unless you want to walk through miles of boring
        forest before even really starting the ascent.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a long bus ride from our Airbnb, we reached the 5th Station around
        noon on September 9th. The trail starts out as wide stone steps through
        the forest but quickly becomes a dirt path.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/after-5th-station.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_after-5th-station.jpg" alt="The trail right after 5th station">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        As we progressed up the mountain the trees began to thin and the soil
        started to get darker and more volcanic. The trail thus far was pretty
        easy, just a gentle dirt slope shaded by trees. Being the summer in
        Japan it was still quite hot, but we made good progress on the first
        section of our trek.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">

          <img src="images/th_on-the-trail.jpg" alt="Taking a break on the trail
          between 5th and 6th Station">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        At about 2300 meters we broke through the treeline into a vast expanse
        of dirt and grass, with clouds periodically obscuring our view. We could
        see a few hikers making their way down the descending trail a few
        hundred meters away.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">

          treeline">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        By 2:05 PM we reached the first stopping point of the hike, Subashiri
        6th station, elevation 2,450 meters. This is one of the numerous mountain
        huts on the route to the top, where you can stop, buy some water or
        snacks, and rest for a bit. The ones higher up also have places where
        you can spend the night.
      </p>

      <p>
        We rested here briefly, meeting a group of Californian hikers we had
        seen on the bus, then continued the climb.
      </p>

      <p>
        The vegetation continued to thin as we passed through a layer of
        clouds. The trail started to become steeper and rockier too, comprised
        of melon-sized igneous rocks and fine dark pebbles. We finally reached
        Subashiri 7th Station, elevation 3,090 meters, at 4:20 PM, and took
        another break.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/7th-station.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_7th-station.jpg" alt="Selfie at Subashiri 7th Station">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        By this point we were getting pretty tired, but there was still another
        310 vertical meters to go before we could rest for the night. We pressed
        on, as the trail continued to get steeper.
      </p>

      <p>
        As our elevation continued to increase, the air became increasingly thin
        and cold. The temperature was fine while we were walking, but it quickly
        became chilly if we stopped for too long. I had heard some horror
        stories of people getting altitude sickness on the mountain, and while I
        wasn't affected too badly I did find myself out of breath almost
        constantly.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the time we reached the Former 7th Station at 3200 meters the
        vegetation was almost entirely gone, and the mountainside was just a
        bare slope of slippery volcanic gravel with switchbacks carved into it.
      </p>

        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        I don't think I've ever felt more exhausted in my life than when we
        reached Subashiri 8th Station, just as the sun was setting. The mountain
        hut we had reserved for the night, Tomoe-kan, was here&mdash;3,400
        meters above sea level. 
      </p>

      <p>
        We reached the hut at 6:20 PM, just in time to get some amazing pictures
        of the cloudscape lit by the sunset on the far side of the mountain. The
        air temperature was 9 degrees Celsius and the wind was fierce, but the
        warmth of the mountain hut helped us recover quick.
      </p>

        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Although we had barely seen anyone on the trail that day the mountain
        hut was crowded with tired but excited hikers (maybe they started
        earlier than us, or took the easier Yoshida trail). The Tomoe-kan staff
        served us a basic dinner of microwaved curry rice and showed us to our
        accommodations. We were given a sleeping bag and camping pillow and
        placed in groups of four in a tiny wooden bunk. I won't say it was the
        best sleep of my life, but it was good enough after a long and tiring
        day.
      </p>

      <h2 id="day-2-summit-push">Day 2: Summit push</h2>

      <p>
        Most people who spend a night on the mountain aim to reach the summit in
        time to see the sunrise, which means leaving the mountain hut while it's
        still dark. Our initial plan was to wake up at 1:30 AM to do just that.
        We set our alarms, got up on time, and prepared to set out into the cold
        and dark. But just as we were getting ready to walk out the door a
        veteran trail guide started addressing all the hikers who were getting
        ready to go at the same time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Apparently there had been a pretty serious rockslide the night before
        that had damaged one of the lower stations. The guides were telling
        people not to go outside until it got lighter out because of the danger
        posed by possible future rockslides.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not wanting to miss this once-in-a-lifetime chance to see the sunrise
        from the summit of Mount Fuji, we came up with a plan. We would wait a
        bit before leaving the mountain hut, but only until 4:00 AM. Sunrise was
        at 5:20, so we could wait to see how the rockslide situation progressed
        and still make it to the summit in time if we hurried.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you intend to climb Mount Fuji I'd recommend bringing a lot of water.
        I brought 1.5 liters and it was definitely not enough, so at this point
        I bought some more (for 500 yen per bottle) at the 8th station. Some of
        my teammates also bought a cannister of oxygen to share for 1500 yen.
      </p>

      <p>
        By 4:00 we hadn't heard anything else about rockslides, so we left
        Tomoe-kan to start the final 376 meter push to the summit. The Yoshida
        and Subashiri trails meet up at the 8th Station and continue to the top
        as one trail, so it was significantly more crowded than the previous
        day. The headlamps of fellow hikers illuminated a winding path up the
        face of mountain before us.
      </p>

      <p>
        This last section of the trail was the steepest, but after a good few
        hours of sleep we made good progress. The loose rock scrambles along the
        way were a bit treacherous in the dark, but it never got too hairy.
      </p>

      <p>
        By 4:40 we reached the 9th and final station at about 3,500 meters just
        as the sky was starting to light up. We took a quick break and joined
        the long line of hikers hurrying to catch the sunrise.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/almost-summit.jpg">

        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The early morning air was bitterly cold, and it only got thinner as we
        climbed ever higher. This combined with the long line of other hikers
        trying to reach the summit made progress in this last stretch
        agonizingly slow.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite all that, at 5:10 AM we triumphantly hauled ourselves over the
        eastern edge of the summit crater, just in time to witness the full
        glory of the sunrise.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/sunrise.jpg">

      </figure>

      <p>
        It was an exhausting 17 hours of hiking, involving 1,700 meters of
        elevation gain and less than five hours of sleep. Mount Fuji is by far
        the highest and hardest mountain I've climbed, and although it was a
        difficult hike that view of the sunrise made it all worth it.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/summit-selfie.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_summit-selfie.jpg" alt="A selfie at the summit">

      </figure>

      <h2 id="around-the-crater">Around the crater</h2>

      <p>
        Though the eastern edge of the crater is the best for viewing the
        sunrise, the actual highest point in all of Japan is on the western
        side.
      </p>

      <p>
        The trail around the crater rim dips up and down for an approximately 3
        kilometer loop, so after a break to eat some food and snap some pictures
        we started hiking clockwise around it.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/crater.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_crater.jpg" alt="A view of the Mount Fuji crater">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        There are several shrines and other buildings along the summit trail
        which were cool to stop and look at, but there wasn't much else to do
        but enjoy the view and the downhill sections of the summit trail.
      </p>

      <p>
        The actual highest point in Japan, at 3,776 meters, has an autonomous
        weather station and a stone marker, which we reached at 6:20 AM.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/highest-point-in-japan.jpg">

        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        After a 50-minute hike up and down the other edge of the crater we made
        it back to the end of Yoshida and Subashiri trails on the eastern side.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/fuji-shadow.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_fuji-shadow.jpg" alt="Mount Fuji's shadow cast over the western edge">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <h2 id="the-descent">The descent</h2>

      <p>
        Both the Subashiri and Yoshida trails are together for the final stretch
        between the summit and 8th Station, but after that point they split into
        one ascending and one descending trail each. As we left the summit at
        7:10 AM we opted to take the Yoshida trail down for a change in pace, so
        once we reached the crossroads we headed in that direction.
      </p>

      <p>
        The descending Yoshida trail is a long series of switchbacks made up of
        slippery volcanic sand. While not very steep, it's still tiring to climb
        back and forth while pebbles get into your shoes.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/switchbacks.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_switchbacks.jpg" alt="Switchbacks on the descending Yoshida trail">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The switchbacks seem to go on forever as you continue to climb down; the
        bottom of the mountain never seems to get any closer. But eventually you
        pass back through a layer of clouds, the vegetation starts to come back,
        and you finally reach the treeline again.
      </p>

      <p>
        The final few hundred meters of the Yoshida descending trail are a
        gentle slope through the misty woods that culminates in a dirt road
        leading into a little tourist town around Fuji Subaru Line 5th Station.
      </p>

          <img src="images/th_misty-woods.jpg" alt="The misty trail to Fuji Subaru Line 5th Station">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        This marked the end of our journey at 10:10 AM, less than 24 hours after
        we started hiking. We bought some souvenirs, rested our legs a bit, then
        took the next bus back into town.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mount Fuji was one of the hardest hikes I've ever done, but it's not
        impossible. If you prepare and know what you're going into, anyone in
        okay physical shape can do it. The beautiful views and the knowledge
        that you've climbed one of the most beautiful and iconic peaks in the
        world makes it all worth it.

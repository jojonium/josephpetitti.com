      <h1 class="title">Adventures in system administration - Part 1</h1>

      <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

      <p>
        For the past year or so I've been running a bunch of services off of two
        servers in my apartment. These include several simple websites
        (including this one) served by Nginx, a Plex server, a few different
        game servers, and Transmission-daemon behind a VPN. This worked fine for
        a while, but as my desire to host more things myself grew, the two old
        HP desktops I had been using couldn't keep up. In May 2019 I decided to
        upgrade.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is the first in what I assume will be a long series of blog posts
        describing in detail the process I used to set up my own network of
        virtual servers to handle the tasks I want automated for my personal
        life. The goal is both as documentation for my own purposes, and as a
        guide so others can do the same thing.
      </p>

      <h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

      <p>
        I bought a used Dell PowerEdge R710 2U rack server based on online
        recommendations, with 32 GB of RAM and two Intel Xeon E5620 CPUs. The
        RAID controller it came with could only handle drives up to 2 TB, so I
        swapped it out with a PERC H700. I also bought two 1 TB hard drives to
        use in a RAID 1 array for important OS data, and an 8 TB drive for low
        priority storage. I plan to buy more 8 TB hard drives for expanded
        storage and backups, but this will do for now.
      </p>

      <h3 id="software">Software</h3>

      <p>
        I'll be using <a href="https://www.centos.org/">CentOS 7</a> for both
        host and guest operating systems. This is because it's based on Red Hat
        Enterprise Linux, which has wide support in a lot of server-based
        applications, and also because my prior experience with Ubuntu server
        left me feeling annoyed.
      </p>

      <p>
        For virtualization technology I'm using KVM/QEMU. I tried using
        Spacewalk/Cobbler for system provisioning, but couldn't quite get it set
        up right, so I switched to
        <a href="https://www.theforeman.org/">Foreman</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        With that out of the way, let's get right into setting it up.
      </p>

      <h2 id="step-1-setting-up-the-host">Step 1: Setting up the host</h2>

      <p>
        The first step is obviously to install the operating system, so head
        over to <a href="https://www.centos.org/download/">centos.org</a> and
        grab an ISO. I went for the minimal version because I don't need a GUI.
        That install is pretty straightforward, so the next step is setting our
        host up as a KVM hypervisor.
      </p>

      <p><b>Note:</b> make sure your system is up to date with: </p>

      <code class="block"># yum upgrade</code>

      <p>before proceding.</p>

      <h3 id="install-kvm">Install KVM</h3>

      <p>
        This is simple enough if you know what packages to grab:
      </p>

      <code class="block"># yum install qemu-kvm libvirt libvirt-python \
libguestfs-tools virt-install</code>

      <p>
        Next we have to start the libvirtd service, and "enable" it so it starts
        on boot.
      </p>

      <code class="block"># systemctl enable libvirtd
# systemctl start libvirtd</code>

      <h3 if="create-network-bridge">Create network bridge</h3>

      <p>
        We want our virtual machines to be able to talk to real machines outside
        their virtual network, so we need to set up a network bridge for them.
        By default KVM sets up a NAT'd private network for VMs, which can be
        seen with <code>virsh net-dumpxml default</code>. We don't want our VMs
        to be hiding behind NAT, so you can just leave that alone for now.
      </p>


      <p>
        CentOS 7 uses NetworkManager, wich supports network bridges. We still
        have to install a new package to use them though:
      </p>

      <code class="block"># yum install bridge-utils</code>
      
      <p>
        To set up our brige, we'll have to edit a couple of config scripts.
        <code>cd</code> into <code>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts</code> and
        edit the file corresponding to your physical network interface. Mine is
        called em1, so I edited <code>ifcfg-em1</code>. Make a backup of this
        file somewhere safe, then edit it so it looks like this:
      </p>

      <code class="block">DEVICE=em1
NAME=em1
HWADDR="<i>05:2a:cd:d6:d9:c3</i>"
NM_CONTROLLED=yes
ONBOOT=yes
TYPE=Ethernet
BRIDGE=br0</code>

      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> make sure you replace the MAC address above with your
        interface's real MAC address. It can be seen with <code>ip a</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, we'll create a config script for our bridge, in the same directory
        (<code>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-br0</code>). Make it look
        like this:
      </p>

      <code class="block">DEVICE=br0
NAME=br0
NM_CONTROLLED=yes
ONBOOT=yes
TYPE=Bridge
STP=off
DELAY=0

IPADDR=192.168.1.25
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
GATEWAY=192.168.1.1
DNS1=192.168.1.1

IPV6INIT=yes
IPV6_AUTOCONF=no
IPV6ADDR=2001:db8::1
IPV6DEFAULTGW=fe80::1%br0</code>

      <p>
        You'll likely have to change the IPADDR, NETMASK, and GATEWAY entries
        above to fit your actual network. Restart the networking service and
        we'll be good to go:
      </p>

      <code class="block"># nmcli connection reload
# nmcli connection down em1 &amp;&amp; \
nmcli connection up em1</code>

      <p>
        You might want to reboot the machine as well to make sure everything
        comes back up correctly.  You can verify that everything worked by
        running <code>brctl show</code>. You should see a bridge named
        <code>br0</code> and one called <code>virbr0</code>. The latter is the
        bridge Libvirt created for its default network.
      </p>

      <p>
        We could start creating VMs now, but first we want to install Foreman to
        automate a lot of the work associated with that.
      </p>

      <h3 id="install-foreman">Install Foreman</h3>

      <p>
        Foreman is a big confusing piece of software that includes a lot of
        moving parts, but it will make our lives easier in the future when we
        have a fleet of VMs running different services and want to be able to
        create more on the fly without any direct interaction.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/foreman-architecture.png">
          <img src="images/foreman-architecture.png" alt="Chart of Foreman's
                  various services">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The Foreman installer uses Puppet to install Foreman, so first we need
        to install Puppet:
      </p>

      <code class="block"># yum install https://yum.puppet.com/puppet6-release-el-7.noarch.rpm</code>

      <p>
        Then, enable the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) and Foreman
        repos:
      </p>

      <code class="block"># yum install http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
# yum -y install https://yum.theforeman.org/releases/1.22/el7/x86_64/foreman-release.rpm</code>

      <p>
        Download the installer:
      </p>

      <code class="block"># yum install foreman-installer</code>

      <p>
        Before we run the installer, we have to make sure we have our
        Fully-Qualified Domain Name set up correctly. The FQDN includes the
        machine's hostname and an internet domain that points to it. For
        example, if my server is named <code>steve</code>, the FQDN could be
        <code>steve.example.com</code>. To update the hostname, run:
      </p>

      <code class="block"># hostnamectl set-hostname <i>steve</i></code>

      <p>
        Then edit <code>/etc/hosts</code>. Add a line to it that looks like
        this:
      </p>

      <code class="block">1.2.3.4 hostname.example.com hostname</code>

      <p>
        Make sure you replace 1.2.3.4 with the computer's real internal IP
        address though.
      </p>

      <p>
        With that done, we can run the installer.
      </p>

      <code class="block"># foreman-installer</code>

      <p>When it's finished you should get a block of text like this:</p>

      <code class="block">Success!
* Foreman is running at https://hostname.example.com
    Initial credentials are admin / aUaMiCRtLFXikhAF
* Foreman Proxy is running at https://hostname.example.com:8443
* Puppetmaster is running at port 8140
The full log is at /var/log/foreman-installer/foreman.log</code>

      <p>
        If you can't reach the web interface at the given address, make sure the
        correct ports are open on your server:
      </p>

      <code class="block"># firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service http --permanent
# firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service https --permanent</code>

      <p>
        There are also a few <a href="https://theforeman.org/manuals/1.22/index.html#3.1.5FirewallConfiguration">other
        ports</a> Foreman needs you to have open:
      </p>

      <code class="block"># firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port 69/udp --permanent 
# firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port 8140/tcp --permanent</code>

      <p>
        Now, if you log in to the Foreman web interface with the credentials you
        received from foreman-installer, you should be able to go to the Hosts
        tab and see your Foreman host. You should take this opportunity to set a
        new, secure password.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that we have the host machine configured and set up, that's enough
        for today. Next time we'll get into provisioning our virtual machines
        and setting up fun stuff like LDAP and DHCP.

      <h1 class="title">Training a computer to play Jotto</h1>

      <p>
        I've always liked word games like Scattergories and Scrabble, they tend
        to be a good mix of creativity and strategy. When I had to decide on
        a final project for a graduate-level artificial intelligence class last
        term it was a perfect opportunity to make a program that played a word
        game. But Scattegories and Scrabble are both trivial for machines to
        play&mdash;their decision trees are narrow enough that you can easily
        perform an exhaustive search for the best possible move. One of my
        teammates introduced a much more interesting game for computers to play:
        Jotto.
      </p>

      <h2 id="how-to-play">How to play</h2>

      <p>
        The rules of Jotto are very simple. You and your opponent each pick a
        five-letter secret word and write it down. The goal is to guess your
        opponent's secret word before he or she guesses yours. On your turn, you
        guess a five-letter word and your opponent tells you how many letters it
        has in common with the secret word you're trying to find. For example,
        if the secret word is "apple" and you guess "popes", that's three
        letters in common (two <b>p</b>'s and one <b>e</b>). Players take turns
        guessing words until one of them figures out the other's secret word.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's a very simple game to learn, but the strategies can get kind of
        complex. Most importantly, there's no clear "best move" on each turn,
        which makes it an interesting problem for AI.
      </p>

      <h2 id="the-greedy-best-response-algorithm">
        The greedy best response algorithm
      </h2>

      <p>
        My team designed a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">greedy algorithm</a>
        to choose which word to guess. Put simply, the computer has a dictionary
        with 8,861 five-letter English words to choose from and tries to
        eliminate as many of them as possible each turn, so it can narrow in on
        the human player's secret word. The algorithm works similar to a minimax
        search to provide the best approximate response for the agent. It uses
        several subroutines to pick the word that is expected to narrow the
        list of possible words the most based on the probability that the
        opponent chose each word.
      </p>

      <p>
        This probability distribution is based on word frequency analysis of a
        large dataset of English writing (we used a set of
        <a href="https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">25,000 IMDb movie reviews</a>).
        We also used a flat distribution for testing, and it tended to perform
        worse than the distribution based on actual word usage.
      </p>

      <p>
        To impose a limitation on the computer we prevented it from spending
        more than two seconds per move. This only ended up mattering in the
        first few turns when the list of possible words is still quite large.
      </p>

      <p>
        When tested on words picked by humans the computer guessed the correct
        word in an average of 10.9 moves, often beating human players. You can

        to see if you can beat the computer, or check out our implementation in
        TypeScript <a href="https://github.com/jaturcotte/cs534-final-project/"

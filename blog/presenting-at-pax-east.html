      <h1 class="title">Presenting at PAX East</h1>

      <p>
        For the past few months I've been workin on a procedurally-generated
        top-down twinstick shooter 
        <a href="https://afterlightcaves.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game</a> for the web, as I've
        <a href="designing-an-extensible-power-up-system">written</a> 
        <a href="making-a-2d-game-with-no-art-assets">about</a>
        <a href="ray-marching-in-a-grid-aligned-world">previously</a>. Although
        I've just been developing it when my friends in our spare time, WPI
        selected it to be shown off at their booth at 
        <a href="https://east.paxsite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PAX East</a>. The WPI booth
        showcases student-made games as a way of promoting the school's
        Interactive Media and Game Design (IMGD) program. What this means is
        that I got to go to PAX East for free to show off my game.

      <h2 id="feedback-on-afterlight-caves">
        Feedback on <i>Afterlight Caves</i>
      </h2>

      <p>
        Although <i>Afterlight Caves</i> was only really there to promote WPI to
        prospective students, it was also a perfect opportunity to get valuable
        playtesting feedback from random strangers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Between the three of us we spent a total of 18 hours standing at the WPI
        booth, watching people play, and listening to their thoughts.
        Miraculously, we never once saw the game crash or break in any way,
        which is especially amazing considering we built the whole engine from
        scratch in JavaScript.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the biggest issues we discovered was that players had trouble
        navigating the world. They were getting confused because the walls and
        floor were both black, so you had to remember which side of the colored
        wall border was navigable ground and which wasn't.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <img src="images/afterlight-caves-black-walls.png" alt="Screenshot showing the black walls and floor">
        <figcaption>Old color scheme, with black walls and floors</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        To try to make the design clearer, I added a slight hue to the interior
        of walls, which matches the randomly generated wall outline color.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <img src="images/afterlight-caves-colored-walls.png" alt="Screenshot showing the new subtly colored walls">
        <figcaption>
          New color scheme, with a slight hue on the walls
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        A lot of players also didn't realize that the light-gray blocks are
        breakable, or that they should be collecting power ups. We decided to
        add some hints at the start of the game, like a sign pointing to a gray
        block that says "Break this!"
      </p>

      <p>
        Other than those issues, people seemed to like our game a lot. Many
        tried hard to get a daily high score, and a few players wrote down the
        URL to play later.
      </p>

      <h2 id="trying-new-games">Trying new games</h2>

      <p>
        Getting feedback on <i>Afterlight Caves</i> was good, but the main thing
        I was excited for was trying out all the new games that companies and
        indie developers would be showcasing.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/pax-east-selfie.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_pax-east-selfie.jpg" alt="Me, along with some friends, at PAX East">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <h3 id="carrion"><i>Carrion</i></h3>

      <p>
        I got a chance to play Devolver Digital's new game, 
        <a href="https://devolverdigital.com/games/carrion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><i>Carrion</i></a>,
        at their booth on Friday. It's a sort of "reverse horror" game, where
        you play as the unspeakable tentacle monstrosity hunting down scared
        scientists in a metroidvania/action/platformer type thing.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sprites and pixel art are great, and the way the monster slithers
        over the ground and reaches out with slimy tendrils is really satisfying
        to watch. <i>Carrion</i>'s gameplay is also slick and fun, as you bash
        turrets with grabbed metal crates and consume security guards to grow in
        size.
      </p>

      <h3 id="overpass"><i>Overpass</i></h3>

      <p>
        Another really cool game I got to play was
        <a href="https://overpass.es" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><i>Overpass</i></a>, an indie rhythm game
        that puts a new twist on the genre.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/overpass.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_overpass.jpg" alt="Overpass logo">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The controls are super simple: for each beat you just move into the
        left, middle, or right lane and click the button. The difficulty comes
        from the perspective. Notes are placed on bridges, trees, and hover cars
        that pass over you as you gaze out the top of a fast-moving car. You
        have to both look ahead at what notes are visible and pay attention to
        the perspective to see which ones will pass through your cursor first.
      </p>

      <p>
        In lieu of the standard multiple difficulties per song,
        <i>Overpass</i>'s 30 tracks each have dozens of optional lamps that you
        can ignore to make them easier, or try to grab for an extra challenge.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was cool to get to talk to
        <a href="https://onemrbean.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Molinari</a>, the developer,
        while trying out the game at PAX. I was instantly hooked by the unique
        gameplay and ended up buying the game that night.
      </p>
      
      <h3 id="avicii-invector"><i>AVICII Invector</i></h3>

      <p>
        The other game I ended up buying after trying it at PAX was <i>AVICII
        Invector</i>. This is a more traditional rhythm game with five button
        inputs and three lanes, but its slick presentation and stylish visuals
        made it one of my new favorites.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/avicii-invector.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_avicii-invector.jpg" alt="Overpass logo">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        I almost missed this game entirely though, because all of the branding
        is based around the music artist, 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avicii</a>, rather than
        the game itself. The poster is just a picture of the guy's face, with no
        indication that it's a rhythm game at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        It seems strange, because the gameplay is fun enough to sell the game on
        its own. The game has only 20 tracks and no level editor, so limiting
        it to using only music by one artist feels like a strange move on the
        part of the developers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Still, the music is all quite good, and the tracks are well designed.
        <i>AVICII Invector</i> is a fun and polished experience that will
        satisfy any rhythm game fan. The split-screen local multiplayer is a
        nice addition too.
      </p>

      <h3 id="other-games">Other games</h3>

      <p>
        I played plenty of other fun games at PAX too.
        <a href="https://playphogs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><i>Phogs</i></a> is a wacky and
        colorful co-op puzzls game where two people play as the separate ends of
        a two-headed dog thing. <i>Magic: Legends</i> is an upcoming
        free-to-play <i>Magic: the Gathering</i>-themed <i>Diablo</i>-like
        online action RPG that was actually pretty fun to play. I even got to
        play a few minutes of <i>Doom Eternal</i>, which was super fun.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, PAX was a fun&mdash;albeit exhausting&mdash;experience. Being
        able to talk to actual indie game developers and try out new and
        upcoming games was great, and I was able to get some valuable feedback
        on the game I'm developing.

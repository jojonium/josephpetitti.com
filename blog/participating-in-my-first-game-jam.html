      <p>
        This past weekend I participated my first game jam&mdash;a competition
        in which individuals or teams rush to design and create a new game
        within a time limit, in this case 48 hours. The jam in question was the
        annual <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GMTK game jam</a>,
        one of the biggest in the world. I worked with four of my friends (three
        other programmers and an artist) from 2 PM Friday through 2 PM Sunday to
        create <a href="https://jojonium.itch.io/schlorp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SCHLORP</a>,
        finishing just seven minutes before the deadline. While the game is a
        bit simplistic and bare, it's actually pretty fun to play, and was a
        bunch of fun to make.
      </p>

        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        As in most game jams, teams are instructed to make the vast majority of
        the code and assets of their game during the allotted time. To encourage
        this, the theme of the jam isn't announced until the last minute, and
        all entries have to incorporate the theme in some way. This year's theme
        was "joined together."
      </p>

      <p>
        As soon as the whole team was able to meet up we started brainstorming
        game ideas that tied into the theme. The resulting concept we came up
        with involved playing as a slime that can reach out with a grappling
        hook-like arm and grab enemies and terrain. Once you grabbed an enemy
        you'd be able to pull them back in and stick them to yourself, "joining
        together" and gaining the enemy's power.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within a few hours of drawing up designs we settled on a sketchy,
        chalkboard style for the art direction, and we were ready to begin. All
        the programmers on the team had experience with web technologies and
        JavaScript, so we decided to make a game that can run in a web browser.
        Unlike the <a href="../afterlight-caves">last game I made</a>, this time
        we opted to use a game engine instead of building our own. We chose
        <a href="https://phaser.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phaser 3</a>
        as the engine and started programming Friday night.
      </p>

      <p>
        The decision to use Phaser turned out to be a double-edged sword. The
        engine was great for handling things like spritesheets, animations, and
        input, but also led to some delays and issues. It took us all a while to
        understand the "Phaser way of doing things," a problem exacerbated by
        the engine's inconsistent APIs and confusing documentation. While
        getting started I personally struggled a lot with Phaser's preference
        for using composition design patterns over inheritance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Difficulties setting up the basic scene and entities in Phaser delayed
        the team a bit Friday night, but by Saturday morning we all had a decent
        idea of what we were doing and could expand the game by building on the
        basic components we had already started. Meanwhile our <a href="https://twitter.com/buhl_boy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">team artist</a>
        was busy drawing all the sprites for the player character, enemies,
        pickups, UI elements, and world tiles.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <video src="images/schlorp-bat.mp4" autoplay loop></video>
        <caption>Idle animation of SCHLORP's flying enemy</caption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Between Saturday morning and Sunday afternoon we all worked practically
        non-stop except for a brief break to sleep. I personally implemented the
        flying enemy's AI, the health and damage system, and the powerup system.
      </p>

      <p>
        According to our design plans, each enemy would provide the player with
        a unique powerup for a limited time after they were absorbed by the
        grappling hook attack. Each of these powerups had to apply a unique
        cosmetic change to the player character and have a potentially complex
        behavior associated with the attack button. For example, the flying
        enemy gives a wing powerup that allows the player to double-jump, and
        also shoots out four gusts of wind that damage enemies.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/schlorp-wing-jump.png">
          <img src="images/th_schlorp-wing-jump.png" alt="A slime jumps into the air, shooting four gusts of wind in different directions">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The cosmetic feature was the most difficult to implement, because each
        powerup needed a unique set of sprites for each of the player
        character's six different animations, and these needed to by synced up
        with the player's sprite and drawn either on top of or below it.
      </p>
      
      <style>
        div#blob-box {
          display: flex;
          justify-content: space-between;
          width: 100%;
        }
        @media screen and (max-width: 800px) {
          div#blob-box {
            flex-direction: column;
          }
          div#blob-box img {
            padding-bottom: 0.5em;
          }
        }
      </style>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <div id="blob-box">
          <img src="images/schlorp-blob-without-wings.png" alt="A blobby slime-shaped player character">
          <img src="images/schlorp-blob-with-wings.png" alt="The same blobby slime-shaped character, but with wings">
        </div>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Due to the time constraints we were only able to complete two enemies
        and powerups, the flying "bat" and a walking cannon that allows the
        player to shoot a projectile. We had a third spiky porcupine enemy
        planned, and even had all the sprites completed but ran out of time to
        add it to the game.
      </p>

      <p>
        Still, we managed to finish all the key features of the game and submit
        it in time for the game jam. You can play it online at
        <a href="https://jojonium.itch.io/schlorp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">itch.io</a>
        or <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/799721" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newgrounds</a>,
        and all the source code is available on
        <a href="https://github.com/bandaloo/gmtk2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>
        as free software. We've already received some nice comments and
        suggestions from the itch.io community, and I had a bunch of fun making
        it (and learned some stuff too), so I'd consider that a win. I
        definitely plan to participate in more game jams in the future, so stay
        tuned as I'll probably post about them here too.

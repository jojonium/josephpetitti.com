      <h1 class="title">Solving Advent of Code the lazy way</h1>

      <p>
        <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://adventofcode.com">
        Advent of Code</a> is an annual set of programming puzzles that I've
        <a href="assembling-jigsaw-puzzles-for-advent-of-code">written about previously</a>.
        I've participated in AoC for several years, but 2023 was only the
        second time I've completed a full year as it came out. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/jojonium/advent-of-code-2023">
        All my solutions</a> are written in Haskell, but I had to use some
        "hacky" techniques to get some of the answers.

      <h2 id="day-21">Day 21</h2>
      
      <p>
        <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/21">
        This puzzle</a> involved counting the number of points reachable in
        exactly <code>n</code> steps from some starting position in a 2D world
        with obstacles. Part 1 is easy enough to brute force; with a 131-by-131
        grid and <code>n=64</code> you can simply count ever possible 64-step
        walk from the origin while eliminating duplicates.
      </p>

      <p>
        But part 2 of the puzzle instead gives you an infinite world (the
        original grid tiled infinitely in all directions) and an absurd
        <code>n=26501365</code>. A key insight here is that the start position
        <code>(65, 65)</code> and <code>26501365 % 131</code> is 65, so the map
        of reachable locations forms a diamond centered on the start location
        where the points are all in the center of one of the tiled grids.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think the "correct" way to solve this is to figure out the 9
        different ways a given tile might be filled, depending on whether it's
        inside the diamond, at a point, or on an edge, manually calculate the
        number of reachable points in that configuration, and multiply it by
        the number of tiles that meet that condition. This is not what I did.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead, I realized that the number of tiles on the points of the
        diamonds would always be constant 4. The number of tiles on the edges
        would grow linearly with the size of the diamond. And the number of
        tiles inside the diamond would grow quadratically. Therefore the
        equation for the answer would look something like this:
      </p>

      <code class="block">f(n) = (a * n) ^ 2 + (b * n) + c</code>
      
      <p>
        Where <code>a</code>, <code>a</code>, and <code>c</code> are constants.
        Hey, that looks like a quadratic equation. So all I had to do was
        manually solve for the first few values where <code>x % 131 == 65</code>
        and do a quadratic fit:
      </p>

        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The data is fit perfectly by a 2nd degree polynomial, so my intuition was
        correct. Plugging <code>x = 26501365</code> into that equation yielded
        the correct answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/23">
        Day 23</a> is simple to understand: just find the longest path through
        a 2D maze. But unlike the shortest path, finding the longest path is
        <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness">NP-hard</a>,
        meaning there's probably no general polynomial-time solution.
      </p>

      <p>
        Honestly I don't know what the "smart" way to solve this one is, I just
        let my brute-force solution run for 12 hours and it eventually found
        the right answer.
      </p>

      <h2 id="day-24">Day 24</h2>

      <p>
        I spent a long time thinking through part 2 of
        <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/24">
        this problem</a>. The gist is you have 300 hailstones with an initial
        3D position and velocity vector. You need to find one position and
        velocity you can throw a stone from to have it eventually collide with
        every single hailstone.
      </p>

      <p>
        After turning it over in my head a few times I ended up with a huge
        system of non-linear equations.
      </p>

      <code class="block"># for each hailstone i with
# initial position (hpx_i, hpy_i, hpz_i)
# velocity (hvx_i, hvy_i, hvz_i)

(hvx_i * t_i) + hpx_i = (vx * t_i) + px
(hvy_i * t_i) + hpy_i = (vy * t_i) + py
(hvz_i * t_i) + hpz_i = (vz * t_i) + pz</code>

      <p>
        Repeat this with a different time value <code>t_i</code> for all 300
        different hailstones and you can theoretically solve for the stone's
        initial position (px, py, pz) and velocity (vx, vy, vz).
      </p>

      <p>
        I don't know enough linear algebra to solve that by hand, so I just
        plugged the whole system of equations into
        <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3">Z3 theorem solver</a>.
        After a few minutes it spit out the right answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        One optimizing insight is that you don't actually need all 300
        hailstones, after the first 3 there's only one line that satisfies the
        system so you only need to check for those 3.
      </p>

      <h2 id="day-25">Day 25</h2>

      <p>
        <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/25">
        The final problem</a> gives you a complex graph and asks you to find 3
        edges to remove in order to cut the graph into two disjoint subgraphs.
      </p>

      <p>
        You could implement a complicated algorithm based on the
        <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max-flow_min-cut_theorem">
        max-flow min-cut theorem</a> to find the 3 edges to remove. But they
        also become extremely obvious if you just visualize the graph. I
        plugged the input into
        <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://graphviz.org/">
        Graphviz</a> with <code>layout=neato</code> and got this lovely visualization:
      </p>

        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Then I just remove those 3 edges and count up the size of each subgraph
        for the answer.

      <h1 class="title">Adventures in system administration - Part 2</h1>

      <h2 id="step-2-creating-virtual-machines">
        Step 2: Creating virtual machines
      </h2>

      <p>
        We're almost ready to start creating virtual servers with Foreman. We
        need to get Foreman and Libvirt to talk to each other first, which
        requires a little extra work. First, install the foreman-libvirt package
        like so:
      </p>

      <code class="block"># yum install foreman-libvirt</code>

      <p>Restart your physical server so everything refreshes:</p>

      <code class="block"># reboot</code>

      <p>
        Once it comes back online, you should be able to go to Foreman's web
        interface and set up a Libvirt compute resource. But before we do that,
        we need to make our Libvirt trust Foreman.
      </p>

      <code class="block">root@box# su foreman -s /bin/bash
foreman@box$ ssh-keygen
foreman@box$ ssh-copy-id root@host.example.com</code>

      <p>
        You can leave Foreman user's SSH key in the default location and leave
        the password blank if you want. When prompted, enter the root password
        to copy SSH IDs. At this point, while logged in as <code>foreman</code>
        you should be able to execute:
      </p>

      <code class="block">foreman@box$ ssh root@host.example.com</code>

      <p>to get into a superuser shell. As the final test, try executing:</p>

      <code class="block">foreman@box$ virsh -c qemu+ssh://root@host.example.com/system list</code>
      
      <p>
        If you did everything right up to here it should work without error. Now
        return to the Foreman web interface. Go to <i>Infrastructure &gt;
        Compute Resources</i> and click the big blue "Create" button. Pick a
        cool-sounding name, and choose Libvirt from the Provider menu. For the
        URL, use:
      </p>

      <code class="block">qemu+ssh://root@host.example.com/system</code>

      <p>
        As a final sanity test you can try the "Test Connection" button. If
        everything looks good click "Submit" and you should be all good.
      </p>

      <h3 id="more-foreman-administration">More Foreman administration</h3>

      <p>
        There are a few more things we need to set up before we can start
        conjuring VMs out of thin air.
      </p>

      <p>
        Make sure you have a Libvirt storage pool with 
        <code>virsh pool-list</code>. If you don't already have an active pool
        with autostart turned on, create one like so:
      </p>

      <code class="block"># virsh pool-define-as --name <i>default</i> --type dir \
--target /path/of/your/choice
# virsh pool-autostart <i>default</i>
# virsh pool-start <i>default</i></code>

      <p>
        Next, we want to set up provisioning templates so we can install virtual
        machines unattended. Foreman comes with a few helpful example templates
        to get you started, so we'll just use those for now. They can always be
        customized later.
      </p>

      <p>
        Go to <i>Hosts &gt; Provisioning Templates</i> and find the template
        called "Kickstart default PXELinux." Click on it, then go to the
        Association tab and make sure it's associated with our CentOS 7.6
        operating system (Foreman automagically knows about this OS because it
        knows what it's installed on). Make sure you click "Submit" once you're
        done.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now go to <i>Hosts &gt; Operating Systems</i> and edit CentOS 7.6. Under
        the Templates tab set the same template (Kickstart default PXELinux) as
        the PXELinux template for this operating system and hit Submit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Repeat this process for each of the five provisioning templates needed
        by the OS:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Provisioning template: Kickstart default</li>
        <li>Finish template: Kickstart default finish</li>
        <li>iPXE template: Kickstart default iPXE</li>
        <li>User data template: Kickstart default user data</li>
        <li>PXELinux template: Kickstart default PXELinux</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        While still editing the CentOS 7.6 operating system, switch to the
        Partition Table tab. Associate the included "kickstart default"
        partition table with this OS. Under the Installation Media tab,
        associate the CentOS mirror.
      </p>

      <p>
        Foreman connects to the Libvirt API with the <code>ruby-libvirt</code>
        gem, which we need to install.
      </p>

      <code class="block"># yum install rubygem-ruby-libvirt</code>

      <p>
        Our next step is to set up a DHCP server for our virtual network, using
        Foreman and Libvirt. In the end we want each of our virtual machines to
        have two network interfaces: one attached to <code>br0</code> which
        gives them an IP address from the DHCP server running on our physical
        router, in the subnet 192.168.0.0/16; and another attached to
        <code>virbr0</code>, a purely virtual network in the subnet 10.0.0.0/16.
        The virtual network will be used by Foreman for unattended provisioning
        and kickstarting.
      </p>

      <h3 id="setting-up-dhcp-and-dns">Setting up DHCP and DNS</h3>

      <p>
        Edit the default Libvirt network with
        <code>virsh net-edit default</code> so that it looks like this:
      </p>

      <code class="block">&lt;network&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;default&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;uuid&gt;c9c73310-bd3c-4d04-a758-11bc905edd17&lt;/uuid&gt;
  &lt;forward mode='nat'/&gt;
  &lt;bridge name='virbr0' stp='on' delay='0'/&gt;
  &lt;domain name="virtnet" /&gt;
  &lt;dns&gt;
  &lt;/dns&gt;
  &lt;mac address='52:54:00:7e:be:1c'/&gt;
  &lt;ip address='10.0.0.1' netmask='255.255.0.0'&gt;
    &lt;tftp root='/var/lib/tftpboot' /&gt;
    &lt;dhcp&gt;
      &lt;range start='10.0.0.2' end='10.0.254.254'/&gt;
      &lt;bootp file='pxelinux.0' /&gt;
    &lt;/dhcp&gt;
  &lt;/ip&gt;
&lt;/network&gt;</code>

      <p>
        The TFTP root directory, <code>/var/lib/tftpboot</code>, should have
        already been made by foreman-proxy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, edit <code>/etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf</code> and uncomment these
        lines to allow <code>foreman-proxy</code> to be able to connect to the
        libvirt daemon.
      </p>

      <code class="block">unix_sock_group = "foreman-proxy"
unix_sock_rw_perms = "0770"</code>

      <p>
        Next, cd into <code>/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d</code>. There are a
        few config files we need to edit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Put these in <code>tftp.yml</code>:
      </p>

      <code class="block">:tftp: true
:tftproot: /var/tftproot
:tftp_servername: 10.0.0.1</code>

      <p>
        In <code>dns.yml</code>:
      </p>

      <code class="block">:enabled: true
:use_provider: dns_libvirt</code>

      <p>
        In <code>dhcp.yml</code>:
      </p>

      <code class="block">:enabled: true
:use_provider: dhcp_libvirt
:server: 10.0.0.1</code>

      <p>
        In <code>dns_libvirt.yml</code> and <code>dhcp_libvirt.yml</code>:
      </p>

      <code class="block">:network: default
:url: qemu:///system</code>

      <p>
        And in <code>templates.yml</code>:
      </p>

      <code class="block">:enabled: true
:template_url: https://host.example.com:8443</code>

      <p>
        Add the foreman-proxy user to the libvirt group and restart the daemonso
        that it reloads the config files:
      </p>

      <code class="block"># gpasswd -a foreman-proxy libvirt
# systemctl restart foreman-proxy</code>

      <p>
        Now if you look in <i>Infrastructure &gt; Smart Proxies</i> you should
        be able to see that your smart proxy manages DHCP, DNS, and TFTP.
      </p>

      <p>
        The last bit of administration we need to do it creating some subnets.
        I'm going to make two, because my virtual machines will each have two
        network interfaces. This is pretty straightforward, just go to
        <i>Infrastructure &gt; Subnets</i> and enter the information for each
        one. Make sure you assign proxies for your virtual network under the
        Proxies tab.
      </p>

      <h3 id="into-the-virtual-world">Into the virtual world</h3>

      <p>
        Let's go ahead and create our first virtual server. Go to <i>Hosts &gt;
        Create Host</i> and enter a cool name. Make the Organization and
        Location default, and make sure you choose the Libvirt compute module
        you configured earlier instead of Bare Metal for what to deploy on.
        Configure the Virtual Machine tab however you want. I want this host to
        be an LDAP server, so I think I can leave it with the default 1 CPU and
        2 GB of memory. Under Storage, you should see the virsh pool you created
        earlier. Choose how big you want your virtual hard drive to be, I picked
        20 GB just to be safe. If you change the type to QCOW2 the file that
        represents the virtual disk will grow as it's needed, so it's not the
        full 20 GB unless it's totally full.
      </p>

          <img src="images/th_create-host.png" alt="This is what the Virtual Machine tab should look like">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Under the Operating System tab, we're going to pick x86_64 as the
        architecture and CentOS 7.6.1810 as the operating system. For media
        choose the default CentOS mirror. Select the partition table you
        configured earlier, and the PXE loader will be PXELinux BIOS.  Make sure
        you set a strong root password too. If you click "Resolve" the
        provisioning templates we configured earlier should show up.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/create-host-os.png">
          <img src="images/th_create-host-os.png" alt="This is what the Operating System tab should look like">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Configure the interface tab how you want for your environment. For my
        setup I'm giving each VM two network interfaces: one for provisioning
        attached to <code>virbr0</code> and Libvirt's DHCP, and a primary one
        attached to <code>br0</code> and my physical router's DHCP.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's it! Go ahead and launch that VM.
      </p>

      <h3 id="port-forwarding">Port forwarding</h3>

      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> this section only applies if you are using a Libvirt
        network with NAT for your VMs. I chose to use a network bridge to
        connect my VMs directly to my network, so this I didn't use this in my
        setup.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because our VMs are behind a NAT'd virtual network, we have to port
        forward to make them accessible from the outside world. You should have
        no problem SSHing into your VM from the host they're running on, just
        do:
      </p>

      <code class="block"># virsh net-dhcp-leases default</code>

      <p>
        to find the IP address of your VM. But this address should be
        unreachable from anywhere else in your network or the world. If you want
        to run a server, you'll need to port forward the virtual network.
      </p>

      <p>
        For this example, I'll assume we want to forward TCP traffic on incoming
        port 14122 to local port 22 on a VM with the address 192.168.122.141.
      </p>

      <p>
        Allow connections from the outside:
      </p>

      <code class="block"># iptables -I FORWARD -o virbr0 -d 192.168.122.141 -j ACCEPT
# iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 14122 -j DNAT --to 192.168.122.141:22</code>

      <p>
        And masquerade the local subnet:
      </p>

      <code class="block"># iptables -I FORWARD -o virbr0 -d 192.168.122.141 -j ACCEPT
# iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.122.0/24 -j MASQUERADE
# iptables -A FORWARD -o virbr0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
# iptables -A FORWARD -i virbr0 -o em1 -j ACCEPT
# iptables -A FORWARD -i virbr0 -o lo -j ACCEPT</code>

      <p>
        You can now test it by trying to connect to 192.168.122.1:14122 from any
        other host on your physical network. It should forward you to the
        virtual machine's port 22.
      </p>

      <p>
        To make these changes persist when you reboot, do the following:
      </p>

      <code class="block"># yum install iptables-services
# systemctl enable iptables
# service iptables save</code>
        
      <p>
        If you want to port forward in the future, you should be able to do it
        with just these commands now that you have it set up:
      </p>

      <code class="block"># iptables -I FORWARD -o virbr0 -d 192.168.122.138 -j ACCEPT
# iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 13822 -j DNAT --to 192.168.122.138:22
# service iptables save</code>

    </main>

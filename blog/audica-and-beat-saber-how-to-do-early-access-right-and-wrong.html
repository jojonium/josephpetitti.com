        <i>Audica</i> and <i>Beat Saber</i>: how to do early access right and
        wrong
      </h1>

      <p>
        Very rarely do you get such a perfect case study handed to you as with
        <i>Audica</i> and <i>Beat Saber</i>. Both are early access VR rhythm
        games on Steam and Oculus, both involve hitting red and blue notes with
        the correctly-colored weapon carried in each of you hands, and both are
        damn good fun. Let's take a look at how <i>Audica</i> takes advantage of
        early access to push content to early adopters while <i>Beat Saber</i>
        takes advantage of early access to take advantage of users.

      <h2 id="first-there-was-beat-saber">
        First, there was <i>Beat Saber</i>
      </h2>

      <p>
        In May 2018, <i>Beat Saber</i> was released into early access on Steam and
        the Oculus Store. Before this, there really weren't any good VR rhythm
        games, and certainly none as flashy and fun as this. It had fancy visuals
        and great intuitive gameplay that blended <i>Dance Dance Revolution</i>
        with <i>Fruit Ninja</i>, and was an immediate hit. Within a week it was
        the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/vr-rhythm-game-beat-saber-now-the-highest-rated-game-on-steam-releasing-level-editor-next-week/">
        highest-rated game on Steam</a>. It launched with a tracklist of ten
        songs, and promises of much more.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was a lot of talk and a lot of hype at the time, and this is when
        I first started playing <i>Beat Saber</i>. And admittedly, it's a lot of
        fun.

        <figcaption>Fun, but tiring</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        That Sunday the development team posted <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/620980/announcements/detail/1662269345678184305">
        an announcement</a> on Steam, saying "Soon we will release alfa [sic]
        version of Level Editor... We will share more info on Friday.
        #StayTuned." That week saw a small update with some minor bug fixes and
        added some basic settings (like the ability to adjust audio volume), and
        on Friday there was indeed <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/620980/announcements/detail/3199123443066805793">
        another announcement</a>:
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <p class="quote block">We know you have been waiting for todays Beat
        Saber Level Editor announcement, but the truth is we will need some more
        time for this new feature. Several technical issues has occurred and we
        can’t guarantee you it will be finished this week</p>
      </figure>

      <p>
        (If the English seems broken in all their announcements, it's because
        the team is from the Czech Republic).
      </p>

      <p>
        That was May 11, 2018, over a year ago. The development team never
        mentioned anything specific about the level editor again. Fortunately, 
        the <a href="https://github.com/Ikeiwa/EditSaber">community</a> did the
        devs' jobs for them and released their own editors, but they shouldn't
        have had to.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the next month after that announcement there was exactly
        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/620980/announcements/detail/1660018815112331498">
        one bug fix</a> for a single bug, and total radio silence until June 18.
      </p>

      <p>
        The team posted new <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/620980/announcements/detail/3426558827325442341">
        announcement</a> (in much better English, curiously), full of generic
        platitudes thanking the community and assuring us they're hard at work.
        They claimed to still be working on the level editor, although there
        weren't any specifics, music licensing, a PS VR demo for E3, social
        media and marketing, "new offices, accounting, contracts, invoices
        payments... you name it."
      </p>

      <p>
        The next week, the team published <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/620980/announcements/detail/1693799618703287576">
        another post</a> that said they would start working on a multiplayer
        mode after releasing the level editor. This is the last time we hear
        about multiplayer. Does this sound familiar? Red flags should be going
        off in your head. Just wait, it keeps getting better.
      </p>

        Another month passes. On July 19 they add a new song. That's right, in
        two and a half months of development in early access all the dev team
        made was <i>one</i> new song map (bringing the total to a whopping
        eleven), and a bunch of empty promises.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/620980/announcements/detail/1708449632708343984">
        next real update</a> wasn't until November 26, almost seven months after
        the game's release. This added Expert+ difficulty to all songs (a nice
        addition, but something community-made maps had had for months), some
        basic modifiers like "faster song" and "no arrows," and some graphical
        updates.
      </p>

      <p>
        December added <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/620980/announcements/detail/3142848113551335636">
        two</a> <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/620980/announcements/detail/1708452169977638962">
        new</a> songs, and March added <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/620980/announcements/detail/1809790777736470809">
        five more</a>. However, the March update also added a ten-track paid DLC
        album. That's right, after ten months of doing basically nothing to
        update what is still an <i>early access</i> game, the developers have
        the audacity to ask for more money. The game has sold over 
        <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/beat-saber-sells-one-million-copies/">
        one million</a> copies and still has rave reviews, so it's not like 
        they're short on cash.
      </p>

      <h2 id="why-its-so-frustrating">Why it's so frustrating</h2>

      <p>
        I'd love to be able to write off <i>Beat Saber</i> as a good idea
        handled by incompetent developers and move on to something better, but
        that's the problem&mdash;there is nothing better.
      </p>

          Yes, this is me. No, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-02-11-valve-updates-steamvr-after-beat-saber-players-reach-speeds-not-thought-humanly-possible">
          it isn't sped up</a>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        No other VR game has captured the sheer satisfaction of precisely
        slicing through hundreds of blocks in a matter of seconds the way
        <i>Beat Saber</i> has. <i>Beat Saber</i> isn't just one of my favorite
        VR games, it's one of my favorite games, period. Other rhythm games don't
        even compare to it. That's why it's such a shame that Beat Games, its
        studio, has completely abandoned it.
      </p>

      <p>
        But there is a silver lining to this depressing story. A recent
        challenger might be just what is needed to force Beat Games out of their
        complacency and get back to work.
      </p>

      <h2 id="enter-audica">Enter <i>Audica</i></h2>

      <p>
        In March 2019, just a week before <i>Beat Saber</i>'s DLC went live,
        Harmonix released <i>Audica</i> on Steam and Oculus. You might remember
        them as the developers behind <i>Guitar Hero</i> and <i>Rock Band</i>.
        In <i>Audica</i> you have colored guns instead of colored swords, and
        shoot targets instead of slicing them, but the basic idea is the same.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <video controls>
          <source src="images/audica.webm" type="video/webm">
          Sorry, your browser doesn't support HTML5 videos
        </video>
        <figcaption>
          You have a bit more peripheral vision in-game than is shown here
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Sensing that this could be the answer to my <i>Beat Saber</i> woes, I
        bought <i>Audica</i> the day it launched. I had a few minor complaints,
        but mostly liked it. What really sealed my love of the game was the
        first patch, which came just 24 hours after release and fixed every
        problem I had with it. Like <i>Beat Saber</i>, <i>Audica</i> also 
        launched with a ten song tracklist. But <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1020340/announcements/detail/1826679904515152818">
        within a week</a> that number had climbed to twelve, and by <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1020340/announcements/detail/1791778274985875497">
        April</a> there were 14.
      </p>

      <p>
        On <a href="http://www.harmonixmusic.com/blog/introducing-community-maps-in-audica-update-015">
        April 10</a> Harmonix released documentation and software for creating
        custom maps. That's right, they managed to make a level editor first
        despite Beat Games having an eleven month head start. Oh, and they added
        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1020340/announcements/detail/1657797449837592159">
        two new songs</a> a week later.
      </p>

      <h2 id="what-happens-now">What happens now?</h2>

      <p>
        The point is that <i>Audica</i>'s time in early access has been full of
        development, new features, free new content, and tools the community
        actually wants. <i>Beat Saber</i>'s early access has been... not that.
        I understand that Harmonix is an established studio with money and
        connections, but Beat Games has also been getting tons of money and free
        publicity thrown at them this whole time.
      </p>

      <p>
        My hope is that the entry of Harmonix into the VR rhythm game world will
        end up being good for everyone. In the short term it means we get access
        to more choice in what games to buy, and in the long term the
        competition might stimulate Beat Games to actually fulfill some of the
        promises they made last year.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'll freely admit that <i>Beat Saber</i> is a better game than
        <i>Audica</i>. Slashing flying blocks is way more visceral and
        satisfying than shooting targets. But I'm glad <i>Audica</i> is around,
        as an enjoyable in its own right game and as a vehicle to push <i>Beat
        Saber</i> to be better.

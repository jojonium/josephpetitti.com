      <h1 class="title">How CSS can leak your browser history</h1>

      <p>
        Despite the huge effort that goes into making browsers secure, there are
        still a few ways they can expose your private data to attackers if you
        aren't careful. Most involve some kind of complex fingerprinting using
        JavaScript, but there is a way to trick users into giving up their
        browsing history using only CSS.
      </p>

      <h2 id="the-visited-pseudo-class">The :visited pseudo-class</h2>

      <p>
        In addition to regular selectors for HTML tag name, ID, and class, CSS
        also provides a few special selectors callde pseudo-classes. For
        example, the <code>:hover</code> pseudo-class represents an element that
        the user is hovering over with their cursor.
      </p>

      <p>
        This privacy-invading trick involves the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:visited" rel="noreferrer noopener" ><code>:visited</code></a>
        pseudo-class. It's a way to style links that the user has already
        visited, making long lists of links easier to read.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <img src="images/visited-example.png" alt="A list of links where the ones that have already been visited are a darker color">
        <figcaption>
          This makes it easy to tell which posts you've already read
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The fact that the styling is based on your browser's history makes this
        pseudo-class an obvious security issue. Because of this, browsers
        implement a number of measures to make it difficult to exploit.
      </p>

      <p>
        The only rules you can apply to visited links are <code>color</code>,
        <code>background-color</code>, <code>border-color</code>,
        <code>column-rule-color</code>, and <code>outline-color</code>. Further,
        it's normally impossible to detect whether the rule is being applied
        with JavaScript because <code>window.getComputedStyle</code> pretends as
        if all links are always unvisted.
      </p>

      <p>
        If it weren't for these security measures, you could just include a
        hidden link to <code>www.shady-site.com</code> and then automatically
        test whether the link has the visited style applied to it to figure out
        if a user has gone to the shady site before.
      </p>

      <p>
        So how can you exploit the <code>:visited</code> pseudo-class when you
        can't check if the style is being applied? Just trick the user into
        telling you.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <img src="images/the-brain-manipulates.png" alt="A meme from Arthur
        showing Brain saying 'Have you ever realized how frighteningly easy it
        is to manipulate someone into doing whatever you want?'">
      </figure>

      <h2 id="proof-of-concept">Proof of concept</h2>

      <p>
        It's surprisingly easy to get people to give up their history with a
        little bit of trickery. I made a simple
        <a href="../magic-history-detector">proof of concept</a> that you can
        try out now. Don't worry, it only reports your history to you, check
        <a href="../scripts/visited-demo.js">the source</a> if you don't believe
        me.
      </p>

      <p>
        The page simply assigns a common English word for each of the top 50
        most visited sites in the US, and colors them black if the link is
        <code>:visited</code>. Unvisited links are white and therefore
        invisible, and a few decoy words are thrown in to make it less obvious
        how it works. Then we just put an invisible <code>div</code> over the
        whole thing to prevent the user from clicking or selecting the links,
        which would give away the trick.
      </p>

      <p>
        The user types in all the words that are visible to them, and some
        JavaScript reports all the matching sites.
      </p>

      <p>
        This example is kind of silly, but it's not too hard to imagine
        implementing a CAPTCHA service that only shows certain letters if you've
        visited a particular site. In fact,
        <a href="https://github.com/frantzmiccoli" rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank">Fr√§ntz Miccoli</a>
        has already implemented a
        <a href="https://frantzmiccoli.github.io/visited-captcha-history/#"
          rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">demo that does exactly
          that.</a>
      </p>

      <h2 id="how-to-protect-yourself">How to protect yourself</h2>

      <p>
        These types of tricks are difficult to detect, so the best thing to do
        is just disable styling visited links entirely. You lose the benefit of
        seeing what links you've already clicked on some sites, but it makes you
        more secure.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Firefox, just add this line to your <code>user.js</code> file to
        disable the <code>:visited</code> pseudo-class:
      </p>

      <code class="block">user_pref("layout.css.visited_links_enabled", false)</code>

      <p>
        If there is a way to disable it in Chrome I couldn't find it, but you
        shouldn't really be using Chrome for security anyway.

      <h1 class="title">Making a simple text-based game in C++</h1>

      <p>
        For the WPI course IMGD 3000 - Technical Game Development 1, I worked
        over the course of seven weeks to make a fully-featured game engine in
        C++. It uses simple text-based ASCII graphics and handles events, input,
        sounds, sprites, collisions, and other basic features. As a final
        project, to show off the features of this engine, I worked with a
        <a href="https://www.mattpuentes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partner</a> to make a fun game
        using it. The game, called "XiQ", is a fast-paced arcade puzzle game
        based on the Taito classic
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Qix</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="technical-details">Technical details</h2>

      <p>
        The engine I made is based on Professor Mark Claypool's
        <a href="https://dragonfly.wpi.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragonfly</a> engine, described as
        "a text-based game engine, primarily designed to teach about game engine
        development." Over the course of the term I built up the various
        features of the engine in several increments, which can be seen on
        <a href="https://github.com/jojonium/IMGD-3000-Technical-Game-Development-I/releases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the end of Project 2c my engine had the following features:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Providing a 2D game world with positions, velocities, and
          acceleration for game objects</li>
        <li>Running a game loop with a consistent frame rate (60 Hz)</li>
        <li>Using events to send messages to various game objects</li>
        <li>Providing robust logging capabilities</li>
        <li>2D ASCII sprites and animations</li>
        <li>Accepting non-blocking mouse and keyboard input</li>
        <li>Calculating collisions between objects and sending events to the
          objects involved</li>
        <li>Support for audio, including sound effects and music</li>
        <li>Camera controls, enabling "views" over a subset of the game
          world</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        As well as various other minor features.
      </p>

      <h2 id="game-features">Game features</h2>

      <p>
        To showcase the engine and make a practical project with it, I worked
        with a partner to develop a simple game using it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The game we created is called <b>XiQ: Tactical Zone Control</b>. XiQ is
        a simple game in which you try to claim as much territory as possible in
        sixty seconds while avoiding enemies. You control a green marker called
        a XiQ (pronounced "quiche") that can walk along lines called Xix
        (pronounced "kicks"). You can draw Xix into the center of the play area
        by holding X or Z to draw fast or slow, respectively. When you box in an
        area with Xix it gets filled in, and you get points for the amount of
        area you captured. If you fence in an area by only drawing slowly you
        get ten times as many points, and the area is colored in a different
        color. 
      </p>

      <p>
        However, there are enemies that will try to stop you from claiming
        territory. Xyvz (pronounced "chives") are red X-shaped enemies that walk
        along Xix, and if they touch you you’ll die. The Xiz (pronounced
        "Cheese") is a red line-shaped enemy that flies around the uncaptured
        area of the board. If it hits an incomplete Xix as you’re drawing it,
        you’ll die. Also, if you run into your own incomplete Xix you’ll die.
        Score as many points as possible within sixty seconds to win! 
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/xiq.png">
          <img src="images/xiq.png" alt="Screenshot of Xiq">
        </a>
        <figcaption>The Xiz is the red flying enemy, and the Xyvz are the red
          X's on the wires</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        One of the most difficult technical features of XiQ is the flood-fill
        algorithm we use to fill fenced-in areas with 'o' characters. When the
        player finishes drawing a line of Xix, the game runs a flood-fill
        algorithm on each side of the newly drawn line, filling in an arbitrary
        number of enclosed spaces created by it. All but the biggest enclosed
        area are taken as the captured zone, and are filled in with 'o'
        characters.
      </p>

      <h2 id="how-to-try-it-out">How to try it out</h2>

      <p>
        If you want to try out XiQ for yourself you can download and compile it
        for your system. You can find the source code on
        <a href="https://github.com/jojonium/IMGD-3000-Technical-Game-Development-I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub</a>
        under the <code>project4</code> directory.
      </p>

      <p>
        The README and Makefile in GitHub are designed for a GNU/Linux system,
        but can be easily modified to work on any system.
      </p>

      <p>
        The engine depends on the <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Simple and
        Fast Multimedia Library</a>. To install it on Fedora GNU/Linux, do:
      </p>

      <code class="block"># dnf install SFML-devel</code>

      <p>
        Now just download the code and compile it:
      </p>

      <code class="block">$ git clone https://github.com/jojonium/IMGD-3000-Technical-Game-Development-I.git imgd-3000
$ cd imgd-3000/project4/game
$ make</code>

      <p>
        Just run the <code>./game</code> executable to play.
      </p>

      <h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

      <p>
        Because I haven't done a ton of previous programming in C++, making this
        engine could be frustrating at times. Tracking down segmentation faults
        is always annoying, and some of the Professor's examples were misleading
        or outright wrong.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even so, I feel liks a learned a lot from this class, and seriously
        sharpened my C++ skills. I ended up with a cool project that is actually
        pretty fun to play, and a simple game engine that I could re-use for
        something else in the future.

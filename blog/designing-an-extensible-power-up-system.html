      <h1 class="title">Designing an extensible power up system</h1>

      <p>
        Last term I started working on a simple procedurally-generated twinstick
        shooter, tentatively called Proc Cave Game, with two of my friends as
        our final project for AI for Interactive Media and Games. Although it
        started as just another assignment, we continued to work on it over
        winter break, expanding on what we had started to make a fun and
        interesting game.
      </p>

      <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

      <p>
        Instead of using an existing engine or framework we decided to implement
        everything from scratch. The three of us were most familiar with
        JavaScript, and developing for the web makes a project much more
        accessible, so we opted for using plain ECMAScript 2015 and the HTML
        canvas API built into every browser.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="http://www.bandaloo.fun" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cole Granof</a> did most of the work
        on the engine, writing a game loop that could run at a constant speed
        independent of your monitor's refresh rate and robust kinematic
        simulations based on acceleration and drag.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://www.mattpuentes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matt Puentes</a> worked on an
        efficient collision system, and an algorithm to connect the randomly
        generated cave environments using a minimum spanning tree.
      </p>

      <p>
        I, meanwhile, focused on designing the power up system.
      </p>

      <h2 id="guiding-principles">Guiding principles</h2>

      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Binding_of_Isaac_(video_game)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
          <i>The Binding of Isaac</i></a> is another procedurally generated
        top-down twinstick shooter, and it heavily inspired the design of Proc
        Cave Game. Something I particularly like about <i>Isaac</i> is the way
        different items synergize with each other to create unique gameplay.  In
        <i>The Binding of Isaac</i>, most of these synergies are hard-coded by
        the developer, but I wanted power ups in our game to work together
        automatically.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also wanted every power up to be able to "stack," so that getting the
        same power up twice would make the ability gained from it stronger. This
        way we could have different levels of power ups, and finding the same
        one twice wouldn't be disappointing for players.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, I wanted all power ups to be able to apply to both the player
        and the enemies. This would allow us to apply random power ups to
        enemies to make them stronger, as well as designing new enemy types
        around certain power ups.
      </p>

      <h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
      
      <p>
        The <code>PowerUp</code> super-class is pretty basic, but defines the
        interface that individual power ups must implement. Here are some of the
        methods it defines:
      </p>

      <code class="block">export <span style="color: #44749c">class</span> <span style="color: #44a994">PowerUp</span> <span style="color: #44749c">extends</span> <span style="color: #44a994">Entity</span> {
  <span style="color: #44749c">constructor</span>(
    position,
    magnitude = 1,
    powerUpClass,
    description
  );

  <span style="color: #5b814a">/**
   * called when a creature picks up this power up
   */</span>
  <span style="color: #c4c498">apply</span>(creature);

  <span style="color: #5b814a">/**
   * tests whether the creature is at
   * max level for this power up
   * <span style="color: #44749c">@return</span> boolean
   */</span>
  <span style="color: #c4c498">isAtMax</span>(creature);

  <span style="color: #5b814a">/**
   * what to do when this isn't applied due
   * to the creature being at max level
   */</span>
  <span style="color: #c4c498">overflowAction</span>(creature);

  <span style="color: #5b814a">/**
   * draw the power up in the world as a shiny
   * circle with a letter in the middle
   */</span>
  <span style="color: #c4c498">draw</span>();
}
</code>

      <p>
        You can see the full implementation <a href="https://github.com/bandaloo/proc-cave-game/blob/master/static/game/powerup.js" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on GitHub</a>.
        As you can see, each power up has a <code>magnitude</code>, a number
        from 1 to 5 that describes how powerful it is. This enforces the design
        principle that all power ups have to be able to scale, and multiple
        copies of the same power up stack by essentially having their total
        combined magnitude.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each power up also needs to have some way of checking whether the
        <code>Creature</code> (the player character or an enemy) that picked it
        up is already at the max level for that power up.  For example, the
        power up <code>QuickShot</code>, which increases bullet speed, just
        checks whether the creature's existing bullet speed is above a set limit
        already.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the creature is close to the max, but not quite at it yet, the
        <code>isAtMax</code> method can trim the magnitude of the power up so
        that it still has an affect without going over the limit. Here's how
        <code>QuickShot</code> does it:
      </p>

      <code class="block"><span style="color: #c4c498">isAtMax</span>(creature) {
  <span style="color: #5b814a">// bullet speed is already too high</span>
  <span style="color: #44749c">if</span> (creature.bulletSpeed >= MAX_BULLET_SPEED) {
    <span style="color: #44749c">return</span> true;
  }

  <span style="color: #5b814a">// see if we need to trim magnitude</span>
  const availMag = Math.<span style="color: #c4c498">floor</span>(
    Math.<span style="color: #c4c498">abs</span>(
      MAX_BULLET_SPEED - creature.bulletSpeed
    ) / BULLET_SPEED_FACTOR
  );
  <span style="color: #44749c">if</span> (availMag &lt; 1) <span style="color: #44749c">return</span> true;

  <span style="color: #44749c">this</span>.magnitude = Math.<span style="color: #c4c498">min</span>(
    availMag, this.magnitude
  );
  <span style="color: #44749c">return</span> false;
}</code>

      <p>
        <code>MAX_BULLET_SPEED</code> and <code>BULLET_SPEED_FACTOR</code> are
        constants that determine the maximum bullet speed, and by how much
        bullet speed is increased by each point of <code>QuickShot</code>
        respectively.
      </p>

      <p>
        Applying simple power ups like this are easy, just increase a number by
        the power up's magnitude times <code>BULLET_SPEED_FACTOR</code>. But
        what about more complex power ups? <code>FlameThrower</code> makes the
        player's bullets light enemies on fire. We could give each bullet an
        attribute <code>causesBurning</code>, but this would be annoying to
        maintain as we added more an more power ups. Instead, I used one of the
        most useful features of JavaScript: first-class functions.
      </p>

      <p>
        In JavaScript, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning
        they can be used in the same way as any other data type: passed as
        arguments to other functions, returned from functions, assigned to
        variables, and stored in data structures. This means we can create an
        array of functions to execute whenever a bullet hits an enemy, and
        simply add a function to it that causes burning.
      </p>

      <p>
        See the <a href="https://github.com/bandaloo/proc-cave-game/blob/master/static/game/powerups/flamethrower.js" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">source code</a>
        for <code>FlameThrower</code> for an example of this. This approach
        makes the synergy I mentioned above much easier.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you get an <code>Xplode</code> power up, it makes your bullets
        explode into a ring of sub-bullets. By simply passing these sub-bullets
        the same array of <code>onHitEnemy</code> functions that the parent had,
        they will inherit the same flamethrower effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now you can have flaming, exploding bullets that bounce off walls, and
        the game logic does all the work of combining these effects
        automatically. It can lead to some really complex combinations and
        emergent gameplay.

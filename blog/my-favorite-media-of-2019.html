      <h1 class="title">My favorite media of 2019</h1>

      <p>
        It's the start of a brand new year! And what better way to boldly step
        into 2020 than by talking about a bunch of stuff that happened in 2019.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here I'll list my favorite movie, album, anime, manga, western TV show,
        and video game from 2019. Consider all of these strong recommendations.

      <h2 id="movie-of-the-year-ad-astra">
        Movie of the year: <i>Ad Astra</i>
      </h2>

      <figure class="float right">
        <a href="images/ad-astra-poster.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_ad-astra-poster.jpg" alt="Theatrical poster for Ad Astra">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        <i>Ad Astra</i> is basically <i>2001</i> meets <i>Apocalypse Now</i>
        with a bit of <i>Event Horizon</i> thrown in, how could I not like it?
        Firstly, it's absolutely gorgeous to look at. From the oppressive
        architecture and lighting of the Mars base to the barren serenity of the
        Moon, <i>Ad Astra</i> is a sight to behold.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are a few shots that are very unsubtle imitations of 2001, but
        they still fit into the distinct visual style here. The action scenes
        are also incredibly well done, they're all super tense and well
        designed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Brad Pitt gives a great performance, and his character's personal
        connection kept me more engaged than the admittedly derivative
        surface-level plot. It also deals with some complex themes, including
        trying to live up to a distant father's expectations, and coping with
        the realization that there is no God, in a mature and thought-provoking
        way. I feel like the more I rewatch this the more I'll get out of it,
        and that's always a good sign.
      </p>

        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Overall, <i>Ad Astra</i> is one of the best space movies in recent
        years, but goes beyond the typical sci-fi narrative to tell a new and
        interesting story.
      </p>

      <p>
        Keep in mind there are a lot of 2019 films I haven't gotten a chance to
        see yet, so this is only my tentative rating. Honorable mention to
        runner-up <i>Parasite</i>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="album-of-the-year-fishing-for-fishies">
        Album of the year: <i>Fishing for Fishies</i>
      </h2>

      <p>
        I'll be the first to admit I'm not hugely knowledgeable about music. I
        didn't listen to a ton of new albums released in 2019. But I did like
        Australian psychedelic rock band King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard's
        new album, <i>Fishing for Fishies</i>.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/fishing-for-fishies.png">
          <img src="images/th_fishing-for-fishies.png" alt="Fishing for Fishies album art">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        King Gizzard is known for trying out new genres, and their discography
        includes a spoken word spaghetti western garage rock
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyes_Like_the_Sky" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">album</a>, a
        set of four jazz-fusion acid-rock
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarters!" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pieces</a>, and a
        foray into 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infest_the_Rats%27_Nest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heavy
        metal</a>. <i>Fishing for Fishies</i> is their attempt at making a
        blues album, and includes elements of boogie rock and psychedelic rock.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a complete novice in the world of music, it's kind of hard to explain
        why I like <i>Fishing for Fishies</i> so much. So for now I'll just say
        that I really like the way it sounds, and recommend you go listen to it
        as well.
      </p>

      <h2 id="anime-of-the-year-mob-psycho-100-ii">
        Anime of the year: <i>Mob Psycho 100 II</i>
      </h2>

      <figure class="float left">
        <a href="images/mob-psycho-100-ii-poster.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_mob-psycho-100-ii-poster.jpg" alt="Mob Psycho 100 II release poster">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The second season of <i>Mob Psycho 100</i> is a fun and funny adventure
        that aired last winter. This anime continues following the life of
        middle school-aged esper Shigeo Kageyama, nicknamed Mob. It manages to
        blend action, comedy, and heartwarming emotional moments in a way that
        few other shows can, making it a really enjoyable watch.
      </p>

      <p>
        Studio Bones's excellent animation and ONE's simple yet expressive
        character designs bring the show to life. The action scenes are exciting
        and very dynamic. The sketchy art style and unique visual effects for
        allow the animators to do some wild stuff in the fight scenes.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <video src="images/mob-psycho-100.mp4" controls>
      </figure>

      <p>
        As good as the action is, the characters are the best part. Mob is a
        great protagonist, charming, relatable, but full of insecurities and
        doubts. Watching him grow and mature over the course of the season was
        the main reason I kept coming back each week.
      </p>

      <p>
        The supporting characters each get their own chance to shine, proving to
        be fun and complex in their own right. Reigen in particular is one of my
        favorite characters of any anime series.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">

        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        <i>Mob Psycho 100</i> season 2 was a ton of fun to watch, and I hope
        Bones continues the series in the future.
      </p>

      <h2 id="manga-of-the-year-chainsaw-man">
        Manga of the year: <i>Chainsaw Man</i>
      </h2>

      <figure class="float right">
        <a href="images/chainsaw-man-cover.png">
          <img src="images/th_chainsaw-man-cover.png" alt="Cover of the first volume of Chainsaw Man">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Tatsuki Fujimoto's most recent manga, <i>Chainsaw Man</i> ended up being
        my favorite of the last year. Following the life of a devil hunter named
        Denji who can transform into a chainsaw devil, <i>Chainsaw Man</i> is
        fast, messy, and a lot of fun.
      </p>

      <p>
        Similar to Fujimoto's earlier work, <i>Fire Punch</i> (which is also
        excellent), <i>Chainsaw Man</i>'s frantic pace almost makes it difficult
        to keep up with. The situation is always evolving, characters are being
        introduced or killed, a bigger threat is always being revealed, and
        chainsaws are nearly always ripping through flesh. There's never even a
        nanosecond of filler as <i>Chainsaw Man</i> is constantly racing towards
        some kind of escalation or conclusion.
      </p>

      <p>
        It frequently changes direction completely. If the author gets bored of
        the current situation some new devil will appear to fight the
        protagonists, often killing most of them, to set the stage for some new
        crazy setup.
      </p>

      <figure class="float left">
        <a href="images/chainsaw-man-riding-beam.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_chainsaw-man-riding-beam.jpg" alt="Denji riding Beam, the shark devil">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The result is a manga that can never get boring. From slicing a
        katana-wielding villain in half with a single kick to riding a giant
        shark devil to fight a woman who can make anything she touches explode,
        <i>Chainsaw Man</i> always has something crazy to show us.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fujimoto's art style is a little messy, but he portrays motion really
        well, and has an eye for designing dynamic action scenes. Fights are big
        and bombastic, destroying scenery and body parts of everyone involved.
      </p>

      <p>
        The best part is that <i>Chainsaw Man</i> is just getting started. If it
        turns out to be anything like <i>Fire Punch</i> we're still a long way
        from the conclusion.
      </p>

        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Honorable mention goes to <i>JoJolion</i>, which has been ongoing since
        2011 but really started to ramp up last year.
      </p>

      <h2 id="tv-show-of-the-year-chernobyl">
        TV show of the year: <i>Chernobyl</i>
      </h2>

      <figure class="float right">

      <p class="quote" style="text-align: center; margin-left: 0;">
        You didn't see graphite on the roof because it's not there
      </p>

      <p>
        I didn't watch a lot of western TV shows last year, but I'm confident
        that this would still be at the top even if I had.
      </p>

      <p>
        HBO's <i>Chernobyl</i> is a grounded and serious take on the worst
        nuclear disaster in history, portraying it excellently as a failure not
        only of people and engineering but of the entire Soviet system.
        Likewise, the true cost of Chernobyl was not just the cost of a nuclear
        disaster, it was the cost of lies. Excellent performances from Jared
        Harris and Stellan Skarsgård and the oppressive atmospheric music and
        cinematography elevate it beyond your typical docudrama into something
        great.
      </p>

      <p>
        In terms of historical accuracy, I learned more in ten minutes from
        reading the Wikipedia page, but at least they only bent the truth in
        minor ways. Chernobyl is a harrowing portrait of the worst accidental
        man-made disaster in history, and a must-watch.
      </p>

      <h2 id="game-of-the-year-beat-saber">
        Game of the year: <i>Beat Saber</i>
      </h2>

      <figure class="float left">
        <a href="images/beat-saber-poster.png">
          <img src="images/th_beat-saber-poster.png" alt="Beat Saber poster">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        I've <a href="audica-and-beat-saber-how-to-do-early-access-right-and-wrong">written before</a>
        about how much I dislike <i>Beat Saber</i>'s development process, but
        despite all that it's still a super fun game. Nothing else matches the
        simple joy of dual-wielding light sabers and chopping up hundreds of
        flying blocks per minute, or the elation of full comboing a difficult
        song after many hours of practice.
      </p>

      <p>
        With its full release out of early access last year, I put more hours
        into <i>Beat Saber</i> than any other game that came out in 2019. It's a
        constant source of fun I can jump into for an hour after a long day.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's that timeless rhythm-based gameplay mixed with the inherent
        coolness of cutting flying targets with laser swords that makes <i>Beat
        Saber</i> so fun. If you've never experienced VR games before the only
        way to know is to try it out for yourself. Maybe you'll be hooked like I
        was.

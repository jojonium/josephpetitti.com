      <h1 class="title">Fuji-Q Highland: proof that you can make a theme park
        out of anything</h1>

      <p>
        This weekend I traveled across Japan to climb Mount Fuji, the highest
        mountain in the country and one of the most beautiful and recognizable
        mountains in the world. But before starting the climb, three fellow
        students and I spent a night in Fujiyoshida, Yamanashi to go to Fuji-Q
        Highland, a Mount Fuji-themed amusement park.
      </p>

      <h2 id="getting-there">Getting there</h2>

      <p>
        Merely getting to Fujiyoshida from our residence outside of Kyoto was
        quite a journey. Starting at 9:00 we took a bus to the nearest train
        station, then a local train to Kyoto Station. From Kyoto station we took
        the Shinkansen (bullet train) to Tokyo station. The Shinkansen is
        incredibly quiet and comfortable despite travelling up to 320 km/h.
        Providing fast and convenient transport between major cities without the
        hassle of airports or the discomfort and frequent stops of other rail
        lines, the Shinkansen is now my favorite way to travel.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p>
        At Tokyo station we grabbed a quick lunch of ramen, then took the Chūō
        line to Ōtsuki. At Ōtsuki we transferred to the Fujikyuko line, a slow
        and bumpy local train to Fujikyu Highland. By the time we finally
        reached our Airbnb it had been almost eight hours of travel on a bus and
        four different trains.

      <p>
        The next morning, September 8th, we set out for the park. The forecast
        called for rain starting at noon due to the approach of
        <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/09/09/national/typhoon-faxai/">Typhoon
        Faxai</a>, but we were hoping it wouldn't be as bad as predicted.
      </p>

      <p>
        We were pleasantly surprised to find that the park wasn't very crowded
        in the morning, perhaps because of the typhoon. We were able to ride
        some of the first few coasters with almost no wait time.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first roller coaster we tried was also my favorite of the day: the
        Eejanaika (ええじゃないか, a Japanese term that means something like
        "come on, it's okay"). It's a "4th Dimension Hypercoaster" in which the
        seats start facing backwards and rotate independently of the cars. It
        currently holds the world record for most inversions in a roller coaster
        at 14.
      </p>

      <p>
        Without a huge media company like Disney or Universal behind it, and
        lacking the reputation of a well-known company like Six Flags, Fuji-Q
        has to rely on its rides to drive attendance. This means that their
        roller coasters are all fun in their own right, and many of them were
        world record-holders at some point in time.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, the next coaster we tried, the Fujiyama, was the tallest
        roller coaster in the world in 1996 when it opened at 79 meters. It's
        still among the world's tallest and longest, although it was a bit too
        jerky and rough for my tastes.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Do-Dodonpa's main loop</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Another record-holder, the Do-Dodonpa (ド・ドドンパ, onomatopoeia for
        Japanese drums) was the fastest roller coaster in the world when it
        opened in 2001. Instead of dropping you the cars from the top of a big
        hill, Do-Dodonpa launches you through a tunnel using compressed air.
        Because of this, it still holds the record for the highest acceleration
        in the world, accelerating from 0 to 172 km/h in 1.56 seconds.
      </p>

      <p>
        The downside of this high speed is that the coaster blows through the
        track too fast. Although the track is over 1200 meters long the ride
        only lasts a few seconds.
      </p>

      <p>
        The final record-breaking coaster to experience is the Takabisha
        (高飛車, the kanji for high, flying, and car, which mean "high-handed"
        or "domineering" together). This coaster is still the steepest in the
        world, with a 121° drop angle.
      </p>

        </a>
        <figcaption>Takabisha's 121° drop</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Takabisha starts in complete darkness with a drop and some rolls, then
        is launched into some more complex elements in the open air. The first
        half of the ride is powered by the initial linear motor launch, until
        the car comes to a stop halfway through and is pulled straight up a 90°
        hill. At the top the train pauses for just enough time to anticipate the
        coming beyond-vertical drop before being released.
      </p>

      <p>
        Among all the roller coasters, water rides, and other thrills, Takabisha
        was my second favorite ride of the day.

      <h1 class="title">Zhang Xun: History's Greatest Defensive Tactician</h1>

      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Xun_(Tang_dynasty)">Zhang
        Xun</a> was a Chinese general during the Tang Dynasty, and one of my
        favorite historical figures. He used brilliant tactics to successfully
        defend two fortresses against overwhelming enemy strength, displaying
        extreme loyalty to his empire and protecting southern China from
        being conquered by Yan rebels practically single-handedly. Although he
        resorted to some unfortunate strategies, such as condoning mass
        cannibalism, Zhang is still a fascinating figure with a life story that
        reads like a movie script.

      <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

      <p>
        The Tang Dynasty was a powerful empire that ruled China from 618 to 907,
        often regarded as a golden age in Chinese history. The first half of the
        dynasty's reign was a period of stability and relative peace.
        Unfortunately, this stability ended in 755 when a Tang general named An
        Lushan declared himself emperor of northern China, establishing a rival
        dynasty known as Yan.
      </p>

      <p>
        At first the Yan made quick gains in conquering China. An Lushan treated
        captured Tang generals and officials well, leading more and more of them
        to rebel and join his side. They advanced south and captured the eastern
        Tang capital, Luoyang.
      </p>

      <p>
        Zhang Xun's superior, Yang Wanshi, defected to the rebels' side. He
        tried to force Zhang to become his secretary general, but Zhang refused,
        instead swearing his loyalty to the Tang empire and took 1,000 loyal men
        to Yongqiu to defend against the Yan.
      </p>

      <h2 id="the-battle-of-yongqiu">The Battle of Yongqiu</h2>

      <p>
        Yongqiu had been commanded by an official named Linghu Chao, who had
        also defected to the Yan side and become a general. He left the fortress
        on a campaign but returned to find it occupied by Zhang Xun and his Tang
        loyalists.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yongqiu was an important stronghold because it acted as a gateway to the
        rich and under-defended southern regions of China. If the Tang could
        hold onto the area An Lushan would be confined in northern China, at
        least for a little while.
      </p>

      <p>
        Linghu gathered an army of 15,000 rebels and attacked Yongqiu, hoping to
        recapture the fortress and open the way to southern China. However,
        Zhang Xun brilliantly defended the fort with his 3,000 men. The Yan
        suffered a devastating defeat, losing over 10,000 soldiers, and Linghu
        was forced to retreat.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Linghu wasn't about to give up that easily. He returned the next
        month with a massive army of 40,000 men. Zhang Xun only had 2,000
        able-bodied Tang soldiers remaining.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead of waiting in the fortress for help to come as Linghu expected,
        Zhang led 1,000 soldiers to charge at the Yang army, inflicting massive
        damage. THe Yan retreated for several miles to regroup, which allowed
        Zhang's men to return to the safety of the Yongqiu.
      <p>

      <p>
        Linghu next tried a direct attack using seige ladders. Predicting this
        move, Zhang had ordered his men to make dozens of grass balls soaked in
        oil. He dropped these on the troops ascending the ladders, causing many
        enemy soldiers to burn or fall to their deaths.
      </p>

      <p>
        The rebel army was low on morale after two humiliating defeats, so
        Linghu decided to just wait it out. He surrounded Yongqiu, cutting off
        all means of escape and waiting for the Tang troops to starve.

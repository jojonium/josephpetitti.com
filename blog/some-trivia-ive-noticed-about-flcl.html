      <h1 class="title">Some trivia I've noticed about <i>FLCL</i></h1>

      <p>
        <i>FLCL</i>, a classic six-episode OVA series from Studio Gainax and
        director Kazuya Tsurumaki (known for his work on <i>Evangelion</i>), is
        well known for being kind of confusing. Its blistering fast pace, wild
        animation style, and total disdain for holding the viewer's hand makes
        it difficult to follow on a first viewing. But after watching the series
        maybe a dozen times, I finally think I mostly get what it's about, and
        even noticed a few cool things that I missed on my first viewings.
      </p>

      <p>
        Spoilers ahead, so if you haven't already watched <i>FLCL</i> go do it
        now.
      </p>

      <h2 id="japanese-symbolism">Japanese symbolism</h2>

      <p>
        Clearly coming of age is a major theme of the series, but just in case
        you didn't get that from the recurring sour drinks jokes the show
        literally spells it out for you.
      </p>

      <p>
        The symbol that appears on Canti's and Naota's heads when they get
        possessed by Atomsk's power is made from the kanji for "adult" in
        Japanese (<b>大人</b>, literally "big" and "person"):
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p>
        On the other hand, the symbol that appears on the Medical Mechanica
        giant hand after it acquires the completed terminal core is made from
        the kanji for "child" (usually 子, but can also be <b>小人</b>, "small"
        and "person"):
      </p>

      </figure>

      <h2 id="space-police-fraternity">Space Police Fraternity</h2>

      <p>
        Like <i>Eva</i>, there's a lot of cool lore going on in the background
        that you don't really have to pay attention to if you don't want to. The
        Space Police Fraternity it mentioned exactly twice in the series, and
        has no real relevance to the plot, but it's still a cool bit of trivia.
      </p>

      <p>
        In episode 2 Haruko says her true identity is a
        "フラタニティの宇宙捜査官" (<i>fraternity no uchū sōsa-kan</i>,
        literally Fraternity Space Investigator). 
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/flcl-haruko-fraternity.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_flcl-haruko-fraternity.jpg" alt="1:45 in episode 2">
        </a>
        <figcaption>
          The English dub changed this to "First-Class Space Patrol Officer"
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        This could probably be disregarded as another lie from her (she also
        claims to be a wandering housekeeper and a nurse), except that Commander
        Amarao brings it up again later in episode 4. While interrogating Naota
        he asks if he's heard of the 宇宙警察フラタニティ (<i>Uchū keisatsu
        fraternity</i>, literally Space Police Fraternity):
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/flcl-amarao-fraternity.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_flcl-amarao-fraternity.jpg" alt="13:41 in episode 2">
        </a>
        <figcaption>
          The English dub called it the "Galaxy Space Police Brotherhood"
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        What's interesting is that the organization that protects humanity from
        space monsters in Tsurumaki's next series, <i>Diebuster</i>, is also
        called The Fraternity, also uses children whose brains can break the
        laws of physics, and also talks to its agents through cat telepathy.
        This reference would have been totally lost if you only watched the dub.
      </p>

      <h2 id="director-cameos">Director cameos</h2>

      <p>
        Although credited as "<b>?</b>", Naota's fat cat Miyu Miyu is actually
        voiced by <i>Neon Genesis Evangelion</i> director Hideaki Anno. Miyu
        Miyu never talks, but he does make wierd and hilarious cat noises. Anno
        would later go on to voice the protagonist of the 2013 Studio Ghibli
        film <i>The Wind Rises</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, the giant hand that reaches out for the Medical Mechanica
        iron is traced from a photograph of director Kazuya Tsurumaki.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">

          <img src="images/th_flcl-hand.jpg" alt="Tsurumaki's hand in episode 5">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <h2 id="guitar-continuity">Guitar continuity</h2>

      <p>
        Haruko's guitar, or "bat," is a blue Rickenbacker 4001, which has a pull
        cord like a chainsaw and also functions as a gun.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/flcl-rickenbacker-4001.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_flcl-rickenbacker-4001.jpg" alt="Haruko's guitar in episode 4">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Haruko also uses a ukulele as a bat in episode 3 (causing it to break
        immediately), and Amarao's tiny guitar as a slingshot in episode 5.
      </p>

      <p>
        Naota has a Gibson Flying V, which gets pulled out of his head in
        episode 4. It also has a pull cord, but Naota never uses it.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/flcl-gibson-flying-v.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_flcl-gibson-flying-v.jpg" alt="Naota's guitar in episode 4">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Atomsk's guitar, variously used by Canti and Naota (but never by
        Atomsk), is a 1961 Gibson EB-0.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <video src="images/flcl-gibson-eb-0.mp4" controls>
      </figure>

      <p>
        In the final episode, Piratized Naota fights with both his guitar and
        Atomsk's, eventually fusing them together to form a cool double-necked
        version.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/flcl-double-neck.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_flcl-double-neck.jpg" alt="Naota's double-necked guitar in episode 6">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        After the FLCLimax, Haruko flies away with the double guitar, leaving
        behind her own Rickenbacker for Naota. This is one of many cases where
        the sequels contradict the original story by having Haruko wield the
        Rickenbacker again, but we won't discuss those.
      </p>

      <h2 id="other-little-things">Other little things</h2>

      <p>
        In episode 4, the reason the satellite bomb got knocked out of orbit is
        because of the baseball Haruko hit into space in the intro of that
        episode.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sequence in episode 5 where Haruko inexplicably wears a bunny suit
        and rides a flying guitar is a reference to the
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-840keiiFDE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daicon IV Opening
        Animation</a>, Studio Gainax's first animated project.
      </p>

      <p>
        Naota's dad, Kamon, is a bit of an otaku. In episode 2 Naota mentions
        that he wrote an <i>Eva</i> book a long time ago, and he references
        <i>Initial D</i> and <i>Gundam</i> among others throughout the series.
      </p>

      <p>
        In episode 3 the Medical Mechanica robot comes out of Ninamori's head
        rather than Naota's. This is because when he collided with her after
        getting hit by Haruko's Vespa (again), there's a very brief moment at
        08:57 where you can see the N.O. channel being transferred.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <p class="quote">You have to start by swinging the bat</p>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Every time I rewatch <i>FLCL</i> I notice something new, so I'm sure
        there's still stuff I missed in this densely packed series.

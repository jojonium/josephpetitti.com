      <h1 class="title">I watched all of Gundam</h1>

      <p>
        Over the past 14 months I watched every TV episode, OVA, and movie in
        the Mobile Suit Gundam franchise in production order. I've seen plenty
        of mecha anime before, but this was the first time I had seen anything
        from the biggest real robot franchise in the world. And I have to say
        I was quite impressed. <i>Gundam</i> has its reputation for a reason,
        with incredible mechanical designs, compelling characters and classic
        stories that hold up to this day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of it is certainly better than others. In general the main
        storyline (termed "Universal Century", or UC) and original creator
        (writer and director Yoshiyuki Tomino) produce the best works, but many
        of the spinoffs are worth watching too.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's my subjective ranking of each entry. It doesn't feel right to
        compare TV shows with movies and OVAs when their budgets, structure,
        and audiences are so different, so I've ranked each format separately.
        Likewise the <i>Build</i> series of gunpla-focused spinoffs are so
        different from the standard Gundam formula that I've ranked these
        separately as well.

      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

      <p>
        I worked with a team of three other WPI students in Hong Kong
        for two months on the preservation and promotion of a
        historically significant precinct in the Central District. For the
        project, I created a
        <a href="https://sctp.petitti.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a> prototype as a
        proof of concept digital platform for our sponsors.
      </p>

      <p>
        In January 2019 I went to Hong Kong with 22 other WPI students
        to complete my Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP), a
        requirement for graduation. In Hong Kong, I was part of a group
        of four students working on a project for the Institute for
        Sustainable Urbanisation, a non-profit public organization
        founded in 2014 and funded by the Hong Kong government and
        private donations. Their mission is to promote livable,
        walkable, and sustainable cities worldwide.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our project focused on conserving the historic heritage of an
        area in the Central District, the business heart of Hong Kong.
        This area, known as the Smart Cultural Triangle Precinct (SCTP),
        contains a lot of unique history and culture, and redevelopment
        projects threaten its old buildings. The SCTP project aims to
        help preserve and promote these buildings as a cohesive cultural
        precinct.
      </p>

      <p>
        My team researched historic conservation in Hong Kong and other
        cities around the world, conducted a survey of locals and
        tourists in the area, and interviewed experts and stakeholders
        to learn more about the challenges involved with SCTP project.
        We conducted a walkability assessment of streets eleven streets
        in the area to determine what needs to be done to make it more
        accessible, and planned a walking tour to promote its history.
        Finally, we created a fully-functional website as an
        informational platform for the precinct.
      </p>

      <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

      <p>
        The SCTP is a triangular area in the Central District defined by
        three major historic sites at its corners:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Tai Kwun</strong>&mdash;Formerly the Central Police
          Station and Victoria Prison, this complex includes some of
          the oldest British colonial buildings in Hong Kong. In
          recent years it has been rennovated and reopened in 2018 as
          a center for arts and entertainment.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>PMQ</strong>&mdash;This buildings stands on the
          grounds of the first government primary and secondary school
          in Hong Kong. The original building was destroyed in World
          War II, and in 1951 the British constructed the Police
          Married Quarters on the site. This building housed high
          ranking married police officers and their families until
          2000, when it as rennovated and turned into commercial
          space.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Central Market</strong>&mdash;One of Hong Kong's
          oldest markets, this site originally opened in 1842, and
          provided locals with stalls for produce, seafood, daily
          essentials, and services like tailoring and knife
          sharpening. The the building that currently stands on the
          site was built in 1939, and is currently under rennovation,
          expected to open in 2024.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The triangle is bisected by the Central&ndash;Mid-Levels
        Escalator, the world's longest outdoor covered escalator system
        and a popular tourist attraction.
      </p>

      <h2 id="methods-and-results">Methods and Results</h2>

      <p>
        We accomplished our objectives using the following methods. We
        conducted surveys with locals and tourists and interviewed
        shopkeepers, experts and stakeholders and synthesized the
        results in our report. In the survey, we asked about people’s
        opinions on the current city walk in the SCTP, and most of them
        were not aware of the walking tours but showed an interest in
        one with more cultural landmarks and historical heritage. When
        asked about a digital platform to get information about the
        area, most people chose a website among the options of blog,
        mobile app and pamphlet, and wanted to see event and
        entertainment information about the SCTP, which guided our work
        on the city walk and website.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">

        </a>
        <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        From our interview results, we found that although most
        shopkeepers think promoting the SCTP will be helpful for their
        business, there is still a lack of knowledge of the history of
        the area among them. Most of the experts we interviewed
        suggested that the government should preserve the heritage in
        the Central District as an area, not just individual buildings,
        and creating the SCTP will promote the preservation efforts. A
        digital platform such as a website and a walking tour could be
        helpful for public engagement, especially with the younger
        generation. As for stakeholders, they are more concerned about
        the interests of the group that they represent. They suggested
        public awareness could be promoted by providing updated walking
        tours and including interesting stories to attract both locals
        and tourists. They said the government should value historic
        buildings of local communities, and try to provide more
        affordable place in sites like PMQ for public engagement.
      </p>

      <p>
        We carried out case study research on existing similar platforms
        focusing on Hong Kong and other cities. We determined what
        content was needed and desired by stakeholders and the public
        based on data gathered from the survey and research. One thing
        that our group noticed when researching websites and apps was
        that we should make ours have a very user friendly and visually
        appealing interface to attract more people. A website was the
        favored option in our survey, and websites are cheaper and
        easier to develop and maintain than apps or physical platforms
        like pamphlets or brochures. They also have a wide reach, as
        anyone with internet connectivity and a web browser can access
        it at any time for free.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p>
        We also observed many streets within the precinct, and made
        notes of specific qualities about each of the streets. Many of
        the observations that we made were about the general
        characteristics of the street, such as whether it was narrow or
        wide, the slope, and any obstacles that were around, including
        cars and people. These specific things are hard to change about
        a street, but the things that can be changed are safety,
        signage, cleanliness and sometimes accessibility. Fixing small
        things like these can be helpful in the long run to promote and
        preserve the SCTP.
      </p>

      <h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>

      <p>
        Based on our results, we developed the following nine
        recommendations, divided into three groups: those related to the
        walking tour, suggestions about the website, and ideas for
        future research.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Walking Tour</strong>&mdash;From the results of the
        survey and our walkability assessment, here are some
        recommendations for stakeholders:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          To help promote the SCTP, we recommend that the government
          improve cleanli ness, add railings to streets with narrow
          sidewalks and busy traffic, and add signage in more
          locations in the area, including bigger signs at the
          entrances to important sites.
        </li>

        <li>
          We propose our walking tour plans to the ISU as a guideline
          for the further im- provement of their walk, in the case
          that the Central–Mid-Levels Escalator is under construction.
          See Sections 4.4.2 and 4.4.3 of the <a
          href="assets/iqp-paper.pdf">full report</a> for details.
        </li>

        <li>
           Tour organizers should include practical information and
           interesting stories and cultural landmarks such as H6
           Conet, Hong Kong News-Expo, and Pak Tsz Park, and historic
           sites such as Man Mo Temple and the Duddell Street Steps.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        <strong>Website</strong>&mdash;Based on our experience
        developing the website prototype, here are the recommendations
        we suggest for the stakeholders and future research on the
        topic:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Because locations of shops and restaurants can change
          frequently, the ISU should hire some maintainer to update
          the information on the map page at regular intervals. As
          development projects are completed, some of the information
          on the site will become outdated too. For example, the page
          on the Central Market should be updated once construction on
          the market has been completed.
        </li>

        <li>
           The site could be updated with information about currently
           ongoing events in the SCTP. Our survey respondents were
           split on the question of what information they would like
           to see from an online platform, but the two most popular
           responses were “News and Events Information” and
           “Entertainment Information.” The website could serve as a
           valuable source of information on events in the area.
           Again, this would require a maintainer to keep the
           information up to date.
        </li>

        <li>
           More interactive features such as a public forum or a blog
           with public comments could be added. Our team determined
           this would be a useful way for locals and tourists to
           interact and learn more about the history and current state
           of the area, as well as voice their opinions and concerns
           about it.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        <strong>General Recommendations and Further
        Research</strong>&mdash;Here are our general recommendations for
        stakeholders in the SCTP area and future groups that continue to
        work on this project.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
           Our interviews show that most preserved buildings are
           public or government sites, and private buildings are still
           at risk. Therefore, we suggest that the Urban Renewal
           Authority (URA) should make an effort to preserve private
           buildings that are important to the local community.
        </li>

        <li>
           We recommend that the managers of each historic and
           cultural site keep the sites open and accessible to the
           local small businesses so that they can remain economically
           stable and the historic sites can sustain themselves.
        </li>

        <li>
           For future groups working on the SCTP project, we recommend
           they research what needs to be done to make an area more
           walkable, how online platforms can be used to effectively
           promote areas like the SCTP, and what work has been done at
           the Central Market and other historic sites around Central.
           If a future group uses a survey, we would recommend they
           plan to conduct it for a longer period of time, and
           translate it into more languages, such as Korean and
           Japanese.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        We hope that the implementation of one or more of these
        recommendations can get more people engaged in the preservation
        of historic sites in the Central District of Hong Kong.
      </p>

      <p>
        This IQP was certainly an enlightening experience for me,
        spending two months in a foreign culture working on a primarily
        social science project. My team did a lot of work that I didn't
        have time to mention on this page, but if you're interested feel
